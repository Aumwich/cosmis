# SIMRULES.md - Core SIMSOC Mechanics
**Open Source Rule Mechanics for Social Simulation Games**

## Overview

SIMSOC (Simulated Society) creates a social simulation where players take on roles in an interdependent society. Players must balance individual survival, group loyalty, and collective welfare while navigating economic pressures and social dynamics.

## Core Principles

- **No Clear Winners**: Focus is on learning about social dynamics, not victory
- **Interdependence**: Player goals require cooperation with others
- **Honor System**: Rules depend on player cooperation; cheating defeats the purpose
- **Natural Forces**: Core mechanics represent unavoidable constraints
- **Human Laws**: Players can create additional agreements and rules
- **Emergent Governance**: No required government structure; political systems emerge organically

## Individual Goals

**Purpose**: Personal objectives that guide your role in the simulation

**Philosophy**:
- Your goals are entirely up to you - they define what success means for your character
- The examples below are just starting points - feel free to create your own goals
- You can pursue multiple goals simultaneously or focus on just one
- Your goals will naturally shape your interactions with others and the society you're part of

**Example Goal Categories**:
*These are just suggestions to spark your imagination. The most interesting goals are often those you create yourself based on how you want to experience the simulation.*

1. **Power**
   - **Objective**: Influence what happens in society as much as possible
   - **Strategy**: Seek leadership positions, control resources, form alliances
   - **Mechanics**: Track influence through positions held and decisions made

2. **Center of Attention**
   - **Objective**: Be a central figure, known to as many people as possible
   - **Strategy**: Engage in visible actions, take public stances, be involved in key events
   - **Mechanics**: Track visibility through interactions and recognition by others

3. **Style of Life**
   - **Objective**: Enjoy the highest standard of living, including maximum Munchies
   - **Strategy**: Accumulate wealth, acquire luxury items, avoid menial work
   - **Mechanics**: Track through Simbucks, possessions, and quality of living conditions

4. **Security**
   - **Objective**: Avoid threats to your position and well-being
   - **Strategy**: Build safety nets, maintain good relationships, avoid risks
   - **Mechanics**: Track through stability of position and resources

5. **Popularity**
   - **Objective**: Be loved and admired by others
   - **Strategy**: Help others, be agreeable, build social connections
   - **Mechanics**: Track through social interactions and reputation

6. **Fun and Adventure**
   - **Objective**: Experience excitement and novelty
   - **Strategy**: Take risks, explore different aspects of the simulation
   - **Mechanics**: Track through variety of experiences and risks taken

7. **Your Own Goal**
   - **The Possibilities Are Endless**: Create a goal that excites you
   - **Examples**: 
     - Start a revolution or maintain the status quo
     - Create the most efficient economic system
     - Test the limits of the simulation's rules
     - Roleplay a specific character archetype
     - Achieve a personal vision for the society
   - **How to Proceed**: 
     1. Define what success looks like for you
     2. Consider how to measure your progress
     3. Share your goal with others (or keep it secret!)
     4. Let your goal guide your decisions in the simulation

**Goal Management**:
- **Selection**: Choose one or more goals at game start
- **Flexibility**: Can change goals during the game
- **Individual Focus**: Goals emphasize personal benefit over societal benefit

**Goal Declaration System**:
Each player may submit one Goal Declaration Card per session with three options:
1. **"Yes, I'm satisfied"** - Positive declaration
2. **"No, I'm not satisfied"** - Negative declaration  
3. **"I've changed my goals"** - Specify nature of change

**Declaration Rules**:
- **Optional**: Not required to submit declaration
- **Single Submission**: Only one declaration per person per session
- **Invalid Conditions**: Multiple submissions, contradictory responses, submissions from absentees/arrested
- **Timing**: Can be submitted anytime during session
- **Direct Submission**: Must be given directly to coordinator by individual

**Effects on National Indicators**:
- **Every 4 positive declarations**: Public Commitment +1 unit
- **Every 4 negative declarations**: Public Commitment -1 unit  
- **Goal changes**: No effect on Public Commitment
- **Abstentions**: No effect on Public Commitment# SIMRULES.md - Core SIMSOC Mechanics

## Overview

SIMSOC (Simulated Society) creates a social simulation where players take on roles in an interdependent society. Players must balance individual survival, group loyalty, and collective welfare while navigating economic pressures and social dynamics.

## Core Principles

- **No Clear Winners**: Focus is on learning about social dynamics, not victory
- **Interdependence**: Player goals require cooperation with others
- **Honor System**: Rules depend on player cooperation; cheating defeats the purpose
- **Natural Forces**: Core mechanics represent unavoidable constraints
- **Human Laws**: Players can create additional agreements and rules
- **Emergent Governance**: No required government structure; political systems emerge organically

## Currency System

**Simbucks**: Basic currency for all transactions, denoted by "$"
- Coordinator-managed bank holds all unowned Simbucks
- No loans or credit available from the bank
- Players can make private lending arrangements

## Regional Structure

**Four Regions**: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green
- All players assigned to a home region at game start
- Must return to home region at start of each session
- Population limits: Maximum 1/3 of total players per region

## Movement System

**Moving (Permanent Relocation)**:
- Cost: $10 to bank via Moving Form
- Effective beginning of next session
- Restrictions: Population limits + unanimous consent of current inhabitants required

**Travel (Temporary Visits)**:
- **Travel Tickets**: One-use tickets for round trips, obtained from travel agencies
- **Private Transportation Certificate**: $25 permanent unlimited travel pass
- **Restrictions**: Cannot exceed 50% of total participants in any region
- **Admission Control**: Regions can refuse entry by unanimous consent of inhabitants

## Survival Mechanics

**Subsistence Requirement**: Every attending player must secure subsistence each session

**Options**:
- **Subsistence Tickets**: Obtained from subsistence agencies (limited supply)
- **Luxury Living Package**: $15 per session from coordinator
- **Luxury Living Endowment**: $25 permanent subsistence for all future sessions

**Failure Consequences**:
- **First Failure**: Lose employment, lose group leadership, forfeit agencies
- **Second Consecutive Failure**: Death/elimination from game

## National Indicators

Four society-wide metrics measuring societal health, calculated each session:

**Food and Energy Supply (FES)**:
- Measures society's adaptation to physical environment
- Are natural resources being developed and replenished to meet population needs?
- Higher score = abundant resources

**Standard of Living (SL)**:
- Measures consumption level and quality of life
- How well are citizens living at present?
- Higher score = better living conditions

**Social Cohesion (SC)**:
- Measures integration between different citizen groups
- Are groups isolated or in destructive conflict?
- Higher score = less destructive intergroup conflict

**Public Commitment (PC)**:
- Measures citizens' commitment to social structure and values
- Are citizens alienated and disengaged from society?
- Higher score = less alienation and disengagement

**Indicator Mechanics**:
- All indicators start at 100 for first session
- Natural decline of 10% each session (entropy)
- Any indicator reaching zero = society collapse and game over
- Low indicators reduce group incomes; high indicators increase them
- Effects calculated at end of each session

## Public Programs

Two programs available to raise National Indicators through investment:

**Research and Conservation**:
- **Purpose**: Promote scientific research and environmental conservation
- **Effects**: 
  - Raises Food and Energy Supply (FES) by 40% of investment
  - Raises Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of investment
- **Investment**: Any individual or group can invest any amount
- **Permanence**: Money invested cannot be withdrawn ("used up")

**Welfare Services**:
- **Purpose**: Address poverty, discontent, and social unrest
- **Effects**:
  - Raises Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of investment
  - Raises Social Cohesion (SC) by 20% of investment  
  - Raises Public Commitment (PC) by 20% of investment
- **Investment**: Any individual or group can invest any amount
- **Permanence**: Money invested cannot be withdrawn ("used up")

## National Indicator Changes

**Starting Values**: All indicators begin at 100 for first session

**Maximum Single-Cause Decline**: No indicator can drop more than 30 units in one session from any single cause, but multiple causes can combine for larger drops

**Automatic Effects Each Session**:

| Action/Event | FES | SL | SC | PC |
|--------------|-----|----|----|----| 
| **Natural Decline** | -10% | -10% | -10% | -10% |
| **Research & Conservation** | +40% of investment | +10% of investment | 0 | 0 |
| **Welfare Services** | 0 | +10% of investment | +20% of investment | +20% of investment |
| **BASIN (per passage purchased)** | -2 units | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **BASIN (per passage completed)** | 0 | +1 unit | 0 | 0 |
| **RETSIN (per anagram completed)** | 0 | +1 unit | 0 | -1 unit |
| **Each Absentee** | 0 | -2 units | 0 | -2 units |
| **Each Unemployed Person** | 0 | -3 units | -3 units | -1 unit |
| **Each Rioter** | 0 | 0 | (varies) | -2 units |
| **Each Guard Post** | 0 | 0 | -5 units | 0 |
| **Each Arrest** | 0 | 0 | -3 units | -3 units |
| **Each Death** | 0 | -5 units | -5 units | -5 units |
| **Individual Goals (per 4 positive)** | 0 | 0 | 0 | +1 unit |
| **Individual Goals (per 4 negative)** | 0 | 0 | 0 | -1 unit |

**Investment Examples**:
- $10 invested in Research & Conservation: FES +4 units, SL +1 unit
- $10 invested in Welfare Services: SL +1 unit, SC +2 units, PC +2 units

**Effects on Group Income**:
National Indicators directly multiply group incomes each session based on societal health:

- **All indicators ≥120**: Basic income increased by 20% that session
- **Any indicator below 90**: Basic income reduced by 10% 
- **Any indicator below 80**: Basic income reduced by 20%
- **Any indicator below 70**: Basic income reduced by 30%
- **Any indicator below 10**: Session ends, that indicator affects income at zero level
- **Any indicator reaches zero**: Society collapse, game over

**Important Notes**:
- Affects basic group income only (not banked assets)
- BASIN and RETSIN banked assets unaffected by National Indicators
- Creates collective economic incentive for societal health
- Single failing indicator can devastate all group economies

## Economic Activities

**Enterprises**: Risky investments with potential 150% returns
- Maximum 1 per player/group per session, 4 total per society per session
- Requires solving 3 puzzles + 50% dice roll for success
- Investment tiers: $20-$100 with corresponding $50-$250 payouts
- Payouts occur beginning of next session

**Munchies (Optional)**: Luxury goods purchasable with Simbucks
- Coordinator may offer desirable items for purchase
- Alternative to or addition to food/beverage options

## Industry Groups

**BASIN (Basic Industry)**:
- **Activity**: Count vowels (a,e,i,o,u) in text passages
- **Economics**: 25% profit margin when performed correctly
- **Capacity**: Up to 5 passages per session
- **Error Penalty**: 10% reduction per counting error; 6+ errors = no payment
- **National Impact**: Raises Standard of Living, lowers Food and Energy Supply
- **Capital Needs**: Insufficient starting funds require external investment

**RETSIN (Retail Sales Industry)**:
- **Activity**: Solve anagrams to find 5-letter marketable words
- **Economics**: Variable returns based on words found (50% profit to 70% loss)
- **Capacity**: Up to 5 anagrams per session  
- **Performance Scale**: 5/5 words = +50%, 4/5 = +20%, 3/5 = -10%, 2/5 = -40%, 1/5 = -70%
- **National Impact**: Raises Standard of Living, lowers Public Commitment
- **Capital Needs**: Insufficient starting funds require external investment

## Political Groups

**POP (Party of the People)** and **SOP (Society Party)**:
- **Objective**: Develop public policies, mobilize supporters, gain influence
- **Philosophy**: Blank slate; members develop ideology based on circumstances
- **Income Formula**: (Support Cards ÷ 40% of Society) × Starting Income × 1.25 × National Multiplier
- **Support Cards**: Each player may submit one card per session for either party

- **Authority**: Final arbiter on rule meanings and violations
- **Jurisdiction**: Player actions, group agreements, rule violations
- **Decision Process**: Simple majority vote, filed via official form
- **Standards**: Must interpret in good faith, not use ingenuity to evade basic rules
- **Income**: Fixed starting amount affected by National Indicators

## Employment System

**Group Structure**: 8 basic groups with designated heads
- **Head Selection**: Based on pre-game preferences
- **Employment Control**: Heads must file Job Schedule to officially employ workers
- **Multi-Employment**: Players can work for multiple groups
- **Agency Ownership**: Counts as employment
- **Salary Negotiation**: Internal matter between heads and employees

**Head Replacement**:
- **Voluntary**: Head resigns and designates successor
- **Involuntary**: Automatic removal for subsistence failure, arrest, or absence
- **New Head Selection**: 
  - No employees: Random selection from same region
  - One employee: Automatic promotion
  - Multiple employees: Majority vote among employees

## Agency System

**Travel Agencies**: 5 tickets per session, can be sold/transferred for $3 fee
**Subsistence Agencies**: 5 tickets per session, can be sold/transferred for $3 fee
- **Reassignment**: If owner absent/arrested, randomly reassigned within same home region
- **Agency Transfer**: Via official form + $3 bank fee

## Death and Elimination

**Causes of Death**:
- Two consecutive sessions without subsistence
- Two consecutive arrests (second arrest = execution)

**Consequences**:
- Complete elimination from society participation
- Become observer/coordinator assistant only
- Each death reduces Standard of Living, Social Cohesion, and Public Commitment by 5 units each

## Minority Group Members (Optional)

**Designation**: Up to 20% of society members may be designated as Minority Group Members
- **Identification**: Wear insignia or armband for clear identification
- **Coordinator Decision**: Optional feature enabled at coordinator's discretion

**Special Vulnerabilities**:
- **Form K Action**: Any two non-minority members can remove minority members from positions at no cost
- **Scope**: Can fire from jobs and/or remove as group head or agency owner
- **Timing**: Can occur at any time during session

**Effects of Form K**:
- **Immediate**: Lose positions for remainder of current session
- **Future**: Cannot hold any basic group or agency position during current session
- **Repeated**: New Form K can be filed in subsequent sessions
- **Resources Protected**: Retain all personal possessions (Simbucks, tickets, certificates, endowments)
- **Simforce Exception**: Minority Group control of Simforce unaffected by Form K
- **Replacement**: New heads/owners designated according to standard rules

**Recovery**: Minority Group Members may reacquire former positions next session if able

**Alternative Option**: Coordinator may require test for group head/agency head eligibility instead

## Social Control Mechanisms

## Simforce (Police/Military System)

**Purpose**: Provides simulation of physical force since actual physical force is prohibited in SIMSOC

**Creating a Simforce**:
- **Minimum Cost**: $25 to bank (larger investment creates larger force)
- **Authorization Rule**: Must specify who can give orders (individuals, groups, majority, etc.)
- **Leadership**: Must designate a head to interface with coordinator
- **Form Requirement**: Use Form L to establish, stating clear authorization rules
- **Renewal**: Must pay $10 per session to maintain or becomes defunct

**Simforce Powers**:

**1. Arrest Authority**:
- **Cost**: $10 per person arrested (paid to bank)
- **Process**: Fill Form L to initiate arrest
- **Execution**: Coordinator carries out arrest when possible
- **Duration**: Arrests last for duration of session
- **Protected Targets**: Cannot arrest if target under protection of another Simforce

**2. Protection Authority**:
- **Automatic**: All Simforce order-givers automatically protected
- **Additional**: Can protect others by listing on Form L
- **Timing**: Protection must be extended before arrest attempt
- **Effect**: Protected persons cannot be arrested until protecting Simforce removed

**3. Attack Authority**:
- **Target**: Can attack other Simforces to remove them
- **Requirements**: Must correctly identify target head name + be $25 larger than target
- **Success**: Target Simforce reduced by 50% if attack succeeds
- **Failure Penalty**: Attacking force reduced by 50% if attack fails
- **Information**: Coordinator won't reveal Simforce sizes or head names
- **Attack Freeze**: Neither force can be enlarged while attack in progress

**Arrest Effects**:
- **Regional Restriction**: Confined to own region, cannot travel
- **Position Loss**: Cannot hold any official positions (groups/agencies)
- **Transaction Ban**: Cannot engage in official coordinator transactions
- **Asset Confiscation**: All Simbucks, tickets, and possessions confiscated
- **Subsistence Provided**: Given free subsistence while under arrest
- **Certificate Retention**: Keep Luxury Living Endowments and Private Transportation Certificates (but cannot use while arrested)
- **Civic Participation**: Support cards, memberships, subscriptions, goal declarations become invalid
- **Release Requirement**: Must still secure subsistence if released during session
- **Execution**: Two consecutive arrests = death

**Simforce Management**:
- **Head Replacement**: Order-givers can replace head if absent/incapacitated
- **Release Authority**: Only arresting Simforce can release prisoners
- **Renewal Decisions**: Simforce head decides whether to renew arrests each session ($10 per prisoner)
- **Automatic Release**: All prisoners released if Simforce removed/defunct
- **Fine Collection**: Simforces may impose fines, but coordinator won't collect them
- **Possession Distribution**: Simforce head receives all confiscated materials

**National Indicator Effects**:
- Each arrest: Social Cohesion -3 units, Public Commitment -3 units
- Creates tension between order/security and social harmony

## Simriot (Civil Unrest)

**Initiating a Riot**:
- **Process**: Sign Simriot Form (Form M) and submit to coordinator
- **Limitation**: One riot form per person per session (multiple signatures = all invalid)
- **Requirement**: Must present form to coordinator for riot to occur
- **Restriction**: Persons under arrest cannot riot
- **Session Validity**: Riot signatures only valid for session in which signed

**Preventing Riots**:
- **Guard Posts**: Any individual can place guard post in any region for $20
- **Process**: Use Guard Post Form (Form N) and pay coordinator
- **Effect**: Makes riots impossible in that region for remainder of session
- **Cost**: $20 per session per guard post
- **Validity**: Guard post only valid for session in which posted
- **Invalidation**: Riot forms become invalid if guard post placed in region before riot form submitted

**National Indicator Effects**:

**Riots**:
- **Public Commitment**: -2 units per rioter
- **Social Cohesion**: Variable based on percentage of population rioting:
  - 5% rioters: No effect on Social Cohesion
  - 10% rioters: -2 Social Cohesion
  - 15% rioters: -6 Social Cohesion  
  - 20% rioters: -12 Social Cohesion
  - 25% rioters: -20 Social Cohesion
  - 30%+ rioters: -30 Social Cohesion

**Guard Posts**:
- **Social Cohesion**: -5 units per guard post (regardless of riot prevention)

## Government

**No Required Structure**: Society has no obligation to establish government and may operate without one

**Voluntary Formation**: Members may form government at any time if desired

**Complete Freedom**: Government supporters may organize and conduct it in any manner they choose

**No Formal Rules**: No official rules regulate government structure, powers, or procedures

**Emergent Governance**: Political structure emerges organically from player decisions and group dynamics

## Special Events (Optional)

**External Shocks**: Coordinator may announce unpredictable outside events affecting the society

**Unpredictable Timing**: Players will not know in advance when events will occur

**Unknown Nature**: Players will not know what the events will be until they happen

**Game Integration**: Events are part of the designed experience, not arbitrary coordinator intervention

**External Pressure**: Simulates outside forces and crises that real societies must handle

## Group Alliances

**Mergers and Federations**: Groups can form alliances without coordinator involvement
- **Resource Continuity**: Coordinator continues providing individual group resources
- **Voluntary Pooling**: Groups choose whether to combine resources
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Can create coalitions, counter-alliances, industry consortiums

## Individual Goals

**Personal Objectives**: Players select individual goals to pursue during the game
- **Flexibility**: Can change goals during play
- **Self-Reporting**: Players declare progress each session
- **Balance**: Creates tension between individual, group, and societal interests

## Optional Mechanics

**Minority Group**: Some players designated as minority members
- **Vulnerability**: Can be removed from positions by any two non-minority members
- **Additional Obstacles**: Face systematic disadvantages

**Special Events**: Coordinator may introduce random external events
- **Unpredictable**: Players don't know timing or nature in advance
- **External Pressure**: Simulates outside forces affecting society

## Constraints ("Laws of Nature")

**Prohibited Actions**:
1. Taking resources without consent (theft)
2. Physical force (Simforce provides simulation alternative)
3. Counterfeiting Simbucks or resources
4. Forging signatures without consent

## Simforce: Law Enforcement and Military

### Overview
Simforce serves as the enforcement mechanism in SIMSOC, functioning as both police and military. It is funded and controlled by the society's governing bodies.

### Establishment and Costs
- **Initialization**: 25 Simbucks to create a Simforce (size 25)
- **Expansion**: Can be increased by 1 unit per Simbuck spent
- **Maintenance**: 10 Simbucks per session
- **Control**: Managed by the society's governing body

### Arrest and Asset Seizure
- **Authority**: Can arrest any player as directed by the governing body
- **Asset Seizure**:
  - All assets of an arrested player are seized
  - Seized assets are transferred to the Simforce commander
  - The commander may redistribute these assets as they see fit
- **Arrest Process**:
  1. Governing body authorizes an arrest
  2. Simforce executes the arrest
  3. All assets are immediately seized
  4. Arrested player cannot access their assets while in custody

### Limitations
- Cannot act without authorization from the governing body
- Must follow the society's laws and procedures
- Subject to oversight by the Judicial Council (JUDCO)

## Session Structure

**Turn Duration**: Typically 20-30 minutes per turn
**Continuous Activity**: Players can take multiple actions during each turn
**Communication Focus**: Heavy emphasis on player-to-player interaction and negotiation
**Form Processing**: Official transactions processed via coordinator forms
**End-of-Session**: National Indicators calculated, incomes distributed, status updated

## Society Size Scaling

**Size Levels 1-5**: All economic values, starting resources, and group incomes scale based on total number of participants
**Automatic Adjustment**: Coordinator determines appropriate size level before game begins
**Consistent Ratios**: Maintains economic balance regardless of player count

## Victory Conditions

**No Traditional Victory**: Game focuses on social learning rather than winning
**Success Metrics**: 
- Individual goal achievement
- Group objective success  
- Society survival and functioning
- Learning about social dynamics and cooperation

**Failure Conditions**:
- Any National Indicator reaches zero (society collapse)
- Inability to maintain basic social functions
- Loss of game's educational value through rule violations

## Design Philosophy

The mechanics create tensions between:
- Individual survival vs. collective welfare
- Economic growth vs. resource/social costs  
- Group loyalty vs. society-wide cooperation
- Short-term gains vs. long-term sustainability
- Order/control vs. freedom/democracy

These tensions drive emergent social dynamics, political coalitions, economic strategies, and moral decisions that mirror real-world societal challenges.
