# SYSTEMRULES.md - Cosmis Technical Specification
**Platform-Agnostic Implementation of SIMSOC Game Mechanics**
*Version 0.4 - June 2025*

## Overview
This document provides the technical specifications for implementing SIMSOC mechanics in Cosmis on digital platforms. It serves as the primary reference for development, focusing on concrete implementation details rather than design philosophy. While initially developed for Discord, these specifications are designed to be adaptable to other platforms like Matrix.

> **Note**: For adaptation philosophy and design process, see `adaptation_process.md`
>
> **Implementation Principle**: For most game mechanics requiring private feedback, use temporary/ephemeral responses (visible only to the command user) rather than direct/private messages. This keeps routine interactions within the main platform interface.
>
> **Private Messaging Usage**: Reserve direct/private messages for significant game events that warrant special attention:
> - Game start notifications with personalized role information and initial instructions
> - Game end notifications with personal results and debrief information
> - Critical updates that players should not miss even when offline
>
> **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
> - **Discord**: Use ephemeral responses for temporary feedback and DMs for private messages
> - **Matrix**: Use thread responses for temporary feedback and direct rooms for private messages

## Technical Reference Architecture

## Core Platform Architecture

### Space Structure

## Adapting Core Mechanics

### 1. Travel Between Regions
- **Basic Travel**:
  - Players use a "visit" command to travel to another region using a travel ticket
  - Each ticket allows visiting 1-4 regions (each region can only be visited once per ticket)
  - May return home at any time to end the journey
  - Cannot revisit the same region twice on the same ticket
  - Players can view their travel status to see remaining destination options and ticket status

- **Travel Rules**:
  - Visitors can only access destination region spaces (no home region access)
  - Each region can only be visited once per ticket
  - Visit ends when player returns home or is removed
  - Players can only be in one region at a time

- **Visitor Management**:
  - Residents can initiate a vote to remove a visitor
  - Requires unanimous vote to remove (any resident can block removal)
  - 2-minute voting period once initiated
  - Only one vote attempt allowed per visitor per visit
  - Visitors can see the vote in progress and its results
  - If not removed, visitor cannot be voted out again during current visit

- **Implementation Core**:
  - System manages space access permissions dynamically
  - Visit history is tracked per ticket
  - Automatic notifications for visit start/end and voting
  - Activity logs in a dedicated travel log space
  
- **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
  - **Discord**:
    - Commands: `/visit region:[name]`, `/travel_status`, `/vote_remove @visitor`
    - Permissions managed via Discord role assignments
    - Travel logs in `#travel-log` channel
  - **Matrix**:
    - Commands: `!visit [region]`, `!travel_status`, `!vote_remove [username]`
    - Permissions managed via Matrix room invites/kicks
    - Travel logs in dedicated Matrix room

### 2. Subsistence System

  - Players must meet subsistence requirements each turn
  - Failure to meet requirements leads to elimination
- **Subsistence Options**:
  - Purchase subsistence when available
  - Automatic deduction of Simbucks for Luxury Living
  - Players can check their current subsistence status
  
- **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
  - **Discord**:
    - Commands: `/buy item:subsistence`, `/status`

   - **Social Cohesion (SC)**: Unity and cooperation within society
   - **Public Commitment (PC)**: Dedication to collective goals

3. **Calculation Formulas**:
   - All indicators start at 100 for first session
   - Natural decline of 10% each session (entropy)
   - **Public Programs Investment Effects**:
     - **Research and Conservation Program**:
       - FES: +0.4 units per Simbuck invested (40% of investment value)
       - SL: +0.1 units per Simbuck invested (10% of investment value)

       - SL: +0.1 units per Simbuck invested (10% of investment value)
       - SC: +0.2 units per Simbuck invested (20% of investment value)
       - PC: +0.2 units per Simbuck invested (20% of investment value)
   - **FES Calculation**:
     - -2 units per BASIN passage purchased
     - -1 unit per arrested player
     - +0.4 units per Simbuck invested in Research and Conservation
     - +3 units per completed group project
   - **SL Calculation**:
     - +1 unit per completed BASIN passage
     - +1 unit per RETSIN anagram word found
     - +2 units per Luxury Living purchase

     - +1 unit per 4 positive goal declarations
     - -1 unit per negative goal declaration
     - +5 units per public program participation
     - +2 units per group project participation

4. **Impact on Economy**:
   - If indicators decline below certain thresholds, group income decreases
   - If indicators rise above certain thresholds, group income increases
   - Thresholds: <80 = -20% income, <60 = -40% income, <40 = -60% income
   - Thresholds: >120 = +20% income, >140 = +40% income, >160 = +60% income

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Systems
1. Player registration and profiles
2. Regional movement
3. Basic economy (Simbucks, transactions)
4. Subsistence tracking

### Individual Goals System

#### Technical Specification

1. **Core Commands**:
   - Set your individual goal for the game
   - Submit a goal declaration each session
   - Check your current goal
   - View all player goals (Spectator only)

2. **Goal Declaration Mechanics**:
   - Players can submit one goal declaration per session
   - Three possible declarations:
     - "Yes, I'm satisfied with how I'm meeting my goals"
     - "No, I'm not satisfied with how I'm meeting my goals"
     - "I've changed my individual goals as follows: [description]"
   - Declarations directly affect Public Commitment National Indicator:
     - Every 4 positive declarations: Public Commitment +1 unit
     - Each negative declaration: Public Commitment -1 unit
     - Goal changes or abstentions: No effect on Public Commitment
   - Invalid declarations (multiple submissions, from arrested/absent players) have no effect
   
3. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - **Discord**:
     - Commands: `/goal set [description]`, `/goaldeclaration [yes|no|change]`, `/goalstatus`, `/listgoals`
     - Feedback provided through ephemeral messages
     - Goals stored in user profile data
   - **Matrix**:
     - Commands: `!goal set [description]`, `!goaldeclaration [yes|no|change]`, `!goalstatus`, `!listgoals`
     - Feedback provided through private messages
     - Goals stored in user profile data

4. **Goal Management**:
   - Players select from predefined goals or create custom ones
   - Suggested goals include: Power, Center of Attention, Style of Life, Security, Popularity, Fun and Adventure
   - Players can change goals during the game by using the "change" option
   - Goals are self-evaluated; no mechanical completion tracking

5. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - **Discord**:
     - Goals are stored privately in the system
     - Goal declarations are submitted via `/goal set [text]` command
     - Players share goals through normal communication channels as desired
     - Spectators can view all goals with `/listgoals` command (for game oversight)
     - Declaration statistics shown to MASMED for National Indicator reporting
   - **Matrix**:
     - Goals are stored privately in the system
     - Goal declarations are submitted via `!goal set [text]` command
     - Players share goals through normal communication channels as desired
     - Spectators can view all goals with `!listgoals` command (for game oversight)
     - Declaration statistics shown to MASMED for National Indicator reporting

### Riot and Guard Post Mechanics

#### Technical Specification

1. **Core Commands**:
   - Participate in a riot (one per player per session)
   - Establish a guard post in a region (costs $20)
   - Renew a guard post for another session (costs $5)

2. **Riot Mechanics**:
   - Riots affect the entire nation, not just specific regions
   - Each player may participate in only one riot per session
   - A riot occurs when enough players join (minimum 3)
   - Riots impact National Indicators:
     - Public Commitment: -2 units per rioter
     - Social Cohesion: Decreases based on percentage of population rioting
       (5%: no effect, 10%: -2, 15%: -6, 20%: -12, 25%: -20, 30%+: -30)
   - Arrested players cannot participate in riots
   - Riot participation is valid only for the session in which it occurs

3. **Guard Post Mechanics**:
   - Guard posts are region-specific (prevent riots in that region only)
   - Cost: $20 to establish, $5 to renew each session
   - Last for one session unless renewed
   - Each guard post reduces Social Cohesion by 5 units
   - Make it impossible for riots to occur in the protected region
   - Players in regions with guard posts cannot participate in riots

4. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - **Discord**:
     - Commands: `/riot`, `/guardpost create [region]`, `/guardpost renew [region]`
     - Guard posts are visually indicated in region channels with a shield emoji
     - Riot events and guard post establishments are announced in #event-log
     - During riots, work-related commands are temporarily disabled
     - Guard posts are visible to all players in the region
   - **Matrix**:
     - Commands: `!riot`, `!guardpost create [region]`, `!guardpost renew [region]`
     - Guard posts are visually indicated in region rooms with a shield emoji
     - Riot events and guard post establishments are announced in event-log room
     - During riots, work-related commands are temporarily disabled
     - Guard posts are visible to all players in the region

## Implementation Considerations

### Work System Implementation

#### BASIN (Basic Industry) Workflow
1. **Core Activity**:
   - Count vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in provided text passages
   - Each passage is a separate work unit
   - Players submit counts in format: `a:[#] e:[#] i:[#] o:[#] u:[#]`

2. **Economic Model**:
   - 25% profit margin when done correctly
   - Up to 5 passages can be completed per session
   - 10% reduction in payment per counting error
   - 6+ errors = no payment for that passage

3. **National Impact**:
   - **Standard of Living**: +1 unit per completed passage
   - **Food and Energy Supply**: -2 units per passage purchased
   - Banked assets unaffected by national indicators
   
4. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - **Discord**:
     - Work submissions via `/work basin submit:[text]` command
     - Ephemeral responses for work feedback
     - Results and payment notifications in private messages for significant amounts
   - **Matrix**:
     - Work submissions via `!work basin [text]` command
     - Private message responses for work feedback
     - Results and payment notifications in private messages for significant amounts

#### RETSIN Workflow

   - Exactly 5 valid English words are pre-selected as targets
   - All target words are exactly 5 letters long
   - Letters may be used multiple times within a word
   - No proper nouns or offensive terms

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players submit as many valid 5-letter words as they can find
   - Each submission is checked against the 5 target words
   - Players should aim to submit many valid words to increase chances of matching targets
   - Only the 5 target words count toward scoring
   
3. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - **Discord**:
     - Work submissions via `/work retsin letters:[scrambled letters]` command
     - Interactive components for word submission

     - Work submissions via `!work retsin [scrambled letters]` command
     - Form-based input for word submission
     - Private message responses for feedback
     - Results and payment notifications in private messages for significant amounts

4. **Scoring Mechanics**:
   - Players earn points based on how many target words they find:
     - 5/5 words = +50% payment
     - 4/5 words = +20% payment
     - 3/5 words = -10% payment
     - 2/5 words = -40% payment
     - 1/5 words = -70% payment
     - 0/5 words = no payment
   - Base payment: 5 Simbucks per anagram

5. **Verification**:
   - Bot maintains a dictionary of valid words
   - Case-insensitive comparison
