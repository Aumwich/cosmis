# Cosmis Design Options

*Alternative design ideas and options to consider for future implementation*

This document captures alternative design approaches, features, and implementation options that have been considered during the development of Cosmis but not definitively included or excluded from the final design. These ideas are preserved for future consideration.

## Status Key
- [?] Needs more research (default status)
- [ ] Under consideration
- [x] Approved for implementation
- [âœ“] Implemented
- [~] Declined

## Discord Channel Structure

### Group Channel Options

1. **Private Group Channels** [~]
   - **Option**: Each basic group (BASIN, RETSIN, POP, SOP, EMPIN, HUMSERVE, MASMED, JUDCO) could have private channels visible only to members
   - **Pros**: Facilitates confidential group discussions, simulates private meeting spaces
   - **Cons**: May reduce cross-group interaction, increases channel count, could fragment communication
   - **Status**: Declined - Preference is to keep communication more open and reduce channel proliferation

2. **Shared Group Workspaces** [?]
   - **Option**: Groups with similar functions share workspace channels (e.g., POP/SOP political workspace)
   - **Pros**: Reduces channel proliferation, encourages cross-group collaboration
   - **Cons**: Less privacy for group-specific planning
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Possible alternative to fully private channels

3. **Temporary Group Channels** [?]
   - **Option**: Groups can create temporary private channels for specific discussions/projects
   - **Pros**: Flexibility without permanent channel bloat, purpose-driven spaces
   - **Cons**: Additional complexity in channel management
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Potential compromise solution

## Game Mechanics

### Support System Alternatives

1. **Anonymous Support** [?]
   - **Option**: Make political party support anonymous to other players
   - **Pros**: Prevents peer pressure, allows for more strategic play
   - **Cons**: Less transparency, harder to simulate real political dynamics
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Possible toggle option for different game modes

2. **Graduated Support Levels** [?]
   - **Option**: Allow players to indicate strength of support (strong, moderate, weak)
   - **Pros**: More nuanced political simulation, additional strategic depth
   - **Cons**: Adds complexity to a simple mechanic
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Potential future enhancement

### Luxury Living Variations

1. **Ultra-Luxury Tier** [?]
   - **Option**: Add a higher tier of luxury living at premium prices
   - **Pros**: Additional economic stratification, more spending options for wealthy players
   - **Cons**: May create too much inequality
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Possible future addition

2. **Luxury Decay** [?]
   - **Option**: Luxury status requires periodic maintenance payments
   - **Pros**: More realistic, prevents permanent advantage from one-time purchase
   - **Cons**: Additional mechanic to track
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Alternative to current permanent luxury model

## Technical Implementation

### Database Approaches

1. **Event Sourcing** [?]
   - **Option**: Store all game events and derive state rather than storing current state
   - **Pros**: Complete audit trail, ability to "replay" game history, easier debugging
   - **Cons**: More complex, potentially higher performance requirements
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Alternative to current state-based approach

2. **Real-time Synchronization** [?]
   - **Option**: Use WebSockets for real-time updates rather than command-based interactions
   - **Pros**: More immediate feedback, dynamic game state updates
   - **Cons**: More complex implementation, higher server requirements
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Potential future enhancement

### Bot Architecture

1. **Multi-Bot System** [x]
   - **Option**: Split functionality across multiple specialized bots (Admin Bot, Economy Bot, etc.)
   - **Pros**: Better separation of concerns, more resilient to failures
   - **Cons**: More complex coordination, potential consistency issues
   - **Status**: Approved for implementation - Currently planned approach, details being finalized

2. **Web Dashboard Complement** [?]
   - **Option**: Add a web dashboard for certain administrative functions and data visualization
   - **Pros**: Better visualization of complex data, easier administration
   - **Cons**: Additional development effort, another system to maintain
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Potential future enhancement

## User Experience

### Onboarding Approaches

1. **Interactive Tutorial** [?]
   - **Option**: Guided interactive tutorial for new players
   - **Pros**: Better learning experience, lower barrier to entry
   - **Cons**: Development effort, may not cover all edge cases
   - **Status**: Needs more research - Desirable but not prioritized for initial release

2. **Role-specific Quick Reference** [x]
   - **Option**: Provide role-specific command sheets and guides
   - **Pros**: Easier reference than full documentation, contextually relevant
   - **Cons**: Maintenance overhead when commands change
   - **Status**: Approved for implementation - Planned for future development

### Accessibility Features

1. **Text-Based Alternatives** [x]
   - **Option**: Ensure all visual indicators have text-based alternatives
   - **Pros**: Better accessibility for screen readers, more inclusive
   - **Cons**: Additional development effort
   - **Status**: Approved for implementation - Important consideration for future development
