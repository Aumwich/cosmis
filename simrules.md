# SIMSOC Simulation Rules
**Core Mechanics for Social Simulation**

## Introduction

SIMSOC (Simulated Society) is an educational exercise designed to provide insights into social dynamics, governance, economic systems, and collective decision-making. The simulation creates a microcosm of society where participants take on various roles within basic groups, navigate resource constraints, and work collectively to maintain societal health as measured through National Indicators.

Participants represent only some of the citizens of the society. Other citizens exist only in imaginary form—certain rules are based on assumptions about these imaginary citizens' reactions. Nevertheless, this is fundamentally the participants' society to shape as they choose.

## Core Principles

The simulation operates on several key principles:

- **No Clear Winners**: Focus is on learning about social dynamics, not victory
- **Interdependence**: Player goals require cooperation with others
- **Honor System**: Rules depend on player cooperation; cheating defeats the purpose
- **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create complex social dynamics
- **Reflection**: Post-simulation analysis is as important as the experience itself

## Participant Goals

The rules are less complicated than they first appear, as you will discover once SIMSOC is in progress. All the details have been included here, but they will not all be needed by everybody. The basic question many people have at this initial stage is simply, "What is the object of the game?"

As an individual participant, there are several objectives:

1. To achieve the individual goal or goals you have set for yourself
2. To help the basic group or groups to which you belong achieve their goals
3. To see to it that the society as a whole is a "success"—however you may wish to define this

If you conscientiously try to achieve these objectives, the larger objective of learning will be achieved.

Before the first session begins, you should complete your Choice Sheet (Form A) indicating your preferences for basic group assignments and individual goals. Write only your name on the Assignment Sheet (Form B) and submit both forms to the coordinator. The coordinator will fill out the Assignment Sheet and return it to you at the beginning of the first session, confirming your group placement and initial region.

You may also be asked to submit a brief goal statement to the coordinator before the first session. This statement should outline your personal objectives for the simulation, which might include acquiring wealth, gaining influence, promoting social welfare, or any other aims you consider important. These statements help the coordinator understand participant motivations and may be used in post-simulation discussions about goal achievement.

- **No Clear Winners**: Focus is on learning about social dynamics, not victory
- **Interdependence**: Player goals require cooperation with others
- **Honor System**: Rules depend on player cooperation; cheating defeats the purpose
- **Natural Forces**: Core mechanics represent unavoidable constraints (the rules in this document)
- **Human Laws**: Players can create additional agreements and rules among themselves
- **Emergent Governance**: No required government structure; political systems emerge organically

## Coordinator's Role

The coordinator's role is kept to an absolute minimum once the society is in process. The coordinator will:
- Maintain the bank
- Receive and process forms
- Carry out other tasks specified in the rules to make the game operate

If questions about the rules arise, the coordinator will guide players to the appropriate section of the rules and help locate appropriate forms, but **will not interpret ambiguous rules or advise players how to deal with situations arising in the game**. The coordinator will do everything possible to avoid becoming enmeshed as a participant in the society once it has begun.

In cases where rules are ambiguous and have multiple possible interpretations, the coordinator will refer the question to a group within the society (typically JUDCO) for interpretation. The coordinator will be concerned only with those aspects of the ambiguous situation that affect their specific tasks as coordinator.

## Minority Group (Optional)

The coordinator may implement this option to introduce additional social dynamics into the simulation. When activated, certain participants will be designated as Minority Group Members. These individuals face structural disadvantages within the society, including the possibility of removal from positions through the collective action of any two non-Minority Group Members. They may also encounter additional obstacles throughout the simulation. This deliberate asymmetry serves as a mechanism for exploring social inequality within the simulated environment.

## Individual Goals

You will be asked to select certain personal or individual goals to pursue during the course of the society. You will have an opportunity to change these goals and to declare at each session the extent to which you feel you are meeting them.

**Purpose**: Personal objectives that guide your role in the simulation

**Philosophy**:
- Your goals are entirely up to you - they define what success means for your character
- The examples below are just starting points - feel free to create your own goals
- You can pursue multiple goals simultaneously or focus on just one
- Your goals will naturally shape your interactions with others and the society you're part of

**Example Goal Categories**:
*These are just suggestions to spark your imagination. The most interesting goals are often those you create yourself based on how you want to experience the simulation.*

1. **Power**
   - **Objective**: Influence what happens in society as much as possible
   - **Strategy**: Seek leadership positions, control resources, form alliances
   - **Mechanics**: Track influence through positions held and decisions made

2. **Center of Attention**
   - **Objective**: Be a central figure, known to as many people as possible
   - **Strategy**: Engage in visible actions, take public stances, be involved in key events
   - **Mechanics**: Track visibility through interactions and recognition by others

3. **Style of Life**
   - **Objective**: Enjoy the highest standard of living, including maximum Munchies
   - **Strategy**: Accumulate wealth, acquire luxury items, avoid menial work
   - **Mechanics**: Track through Simbucks, possessions, and quality of living conditions

4. **Security**
   - **Objective**: Avoid threats to your position and well-being
   - **Strategy**: Build safety nets, maintain good relationships, avoid risks
   - **Mechanics**: Track through stability of position and resources

5. **Popularity**
   - **Objective**: Be loved and admired by others
   - **Strategy**: Help others, be agreeable, build social connections
   - **Mechanics**: Track through social interactions and reputation

6. **Fun and Adventure**
   - **Objective**: Experience excitement and novelty
   - **Strategy**: Take risks, explore different aspects of the simulation
   - **Mechanics**: Track through variety of experiences and risks taken

7. **Your Own Goal**
   - **The Possibilities Are Endless**: Create a goal that excites you
   - **Examples**: 
     - Start a revolution or maintain the status quo
     - Create the most efficient economic system
     - Test the limits of the simulation's rules
     - Roleplay a specific character archetype
     - Achieve a personal vision for the society
   - **How to Proceed**: 
     1. Define what success looks like for you
     2. Consider how to measure your progress
     3. Share your goal with others (or keep it secret!)
     4. Let your goal guide your decisions in the simulation

**Goal Management**:
- **Selection**: Choose one or more goals at game start
- **Flexibility**: Can change goals during the game
- **Individual Focus**: Goals emphasize personal benefit over societal benefit

**Goal Declaration System**:
Each player may submit one Goal Declaration Card per session with three options:
1. **"Yes, I'm satisfied"** - Positive declaration
2. **"No, I'm not satisfied"** - Negative declaration  
3. **"I've changed my goals"** - Specify nature of change

**Declaration Rules**:
- **Optional**: Not required to submit declaration
- **Single Submission**: Only one declaration per person per session
- **Invalid Conditions**: Multiple submissions, contradictory responses, submissions from absentees/arrested
- **Timing**: Can be submitted anytime during session
- **Direct Submission**: Must be given directly to coordinator by individual

**Effects on National Indicators**:
- **Every 4 positive declarations**: Public Commitment +1 unit
- **Every 4 negative declarations**: Public Commitment -1 unit  
- **Goal changes**: No effect on Public Commitment
- **Abstentions**: No effect on Public Commitment

## Currency System

**Simbucks**: Basic currency for all transactions, denoted by "$"
- Coordinator-managed bank holds all unowned Simbucks
- No loans or credit available from the bank
- Players can make private lending arrangements

## Regional Structure

**Four Regions**: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green
- All players assigned to a home region at game start
- Must return to home region at start of each session
- Population limits: Maximum 1/3 of total players per region

## Movement System

**Moving (Permanent Relocation)**:
- A player may move to another region by paying a moving fee to the bank
- Cost: $10 to bank via Moving Form
- Effective beginning of next session
- Restrictions: Population limits + unanimous consent of current inhabitants required

**Travel (Temporary Visits)**:
- A person cannot travel between regions without having either a travel ticket or a Private Transportation Certificate

**Public Transportation**:
- Travel tickets permit temporary visits between regions
- Each ticket is valid for one complete trip (defined as leaving and returning to home region)
- Travelers may visit multiple regions but no more than one stop in each region per trip
- Travel tickets must be presented to the coordinator at the beginning of each journey
- Travel tickets are obtained from travel agency owners

**Private Transportation**:
- A Private Transportation Certificate (Form D) costs $25 from the bank
- Permits unlimited travel for the remainder of the simulation
- Non-transferable except through formal sale process
- Certificate holders may sell or transfer their certificate to another participant by filing Form F and paying a $3 transfer fee
- The bank cannot repurchase certificates once issued

**Travel Agency System**:
- Designated participants receive five travel tickets each session
- Agency owners may use, distribute, or sell these tickets at their discretion
- Unused tickets may be retained for future sessions
- Agencies may be transferred (Form F) with a $3 bank fee
- Agencies are reassigned if the owner is absent, arrested, or targeted by Minority Group Member Action

**Travel Restrictions**:
- No more than 50% of total participants may occupy any region simultaneously
- Regions may refuse entry to travelers by unanimous consent of present inhabitants
- Inter-regional communication is prohibited - participants must act as if sound barriers exist between regions

## Cell Phones/Laptop Use (Optional)

Electronic communication devices may not be utilized for inter-regional communication unless specifically authorized by the coordinator. When this option is activated, such devices may only be operated by MASMED representatives, who serve as the official communication channel between regions.

## Location of Bank

The coordinator's desk or banking station is considered accessible from all regions. Participants may conduct transactions with the coordinator without requiring travel authorization or documentation.

## Subsistence

**Fundamental Requirement**: All members of the society must secure subsistence for every session in which they participate, even if present for only a portion of the session. This requirement may be fulfilled by presenting a subsistence ticket to the coordinator at any point before the session concludes, or by utilizing one of the luxury living options described below.

### Subsistence Agencies

A designated number of participants will be appointed as subsistence agency owners at the commencement of the simulation. These agency proprietors receive five subsistence tickets each session, which they may utilize, reserve, distribute, or sell according to their discretion. Unused subsistence tickets may be retained for subsequent sessions.

A subsistence agency, with its allocation of five tickets per session, may be transferred to another participant (Form F) with a transfer fee of $3 payable to the bank.

### Luxury Living Options

1. **Luxury Living Package**: Participants may secure subsistence by purchasing a Luxury Living Package from the coordinator for $15 per session. This package provides subsistence for the purchaser for the session of acquisition and, at the coordinator's discretion, may include supplementary benefits.

2. **Luxury Living Endowment**: Participants may acquire a Luxury Living Endowment from the coordinator for $25 (Form E). This endowment provides subsistence for the session of purchase and all future sessions. At the coordinator's discretion, it may include additional benefits. The endowment may be transferred to another participant (Form F) with a $3 transfer fee to the bank. The bank cannot repurchase a Luxury Living Endowment once issued. Each endowment provides subsistence for only one individual per session.

### Subsistence Agency Reassignment

The protocols for reassigning subsistence agencies mirror those established for travel agencies. If an owner is absent, arrested, or targeted by a Minority Group Member Action (Form K), the agency is reassigned.

### Consequences of Subsistence Failure

Failure to secure subsistence for a session results in the following consequences at the conclusion of that session:

- **Unemployment**: The participant loses any employment position
- **Leadership Removal**: If heading a basic group, the participant is removed from leadership
- **Agency Forfeiture**: Ownership of any subsistence or travel agency is forfeited and reassigned

During the period of subsistence failure, participants retain the ability to communicate with others and travel if they possess the means. Despite official unemployment, they may participate in ongoing activities and retain any Simbucks or tickets saved from previous sessions. They may submit Support Cards for basic groups and engage in other activities. Upon securing subsistence in a subsequent session, participants must independently secure new employment or leadership positions.

### Repeated Subsistence Failure

If a participant fails to obtain subsistence for two consecutive sessions, they are considered deceased and prohibited from further participation in the society. Such individuals will be requested to observe the society and assist the coordinator in administrative functions.

## Munchies

**Option One**: Munchies represent imported luxury commodities within the simulation. Under this configuration, the coordinator will establish a Munchie Bazaar where participants may exchange Simbucks for food or beverages at rates determined by the coordinator. If this option is implemented, participants should operate under the assumption that the Munchie Bazaar constitutes the exclusive venue for obtaining refreshments during simulation sessions. The importation of external food or beverages to simulation sessions is prohibited when this option is in effect.

**Option Two**: As an alternative to or in conjunction with the Munchie Bazaar, the coordinator may offer various desirable items for purchase using Simbucks. The coordinator will announce the implementation of this option at the commencement of the simulation. Under this arrangement, a comprehensive catalog of available items and their respective prices will be provided to MASMED representatives.

## Enterprises

At any juncture during the simulation, individual participants or consortiums may invest in high-risk Enterprises, with a maximum of one Enterprise per session. Each Enterprise comprises three puzzles that must be resolved before the conclusion of the session in which the investment occurs.

**Risk Structure**:
- Failure to solve all three puzzles results in complete forfeiture of the investment
- Even with successful resolution of all puzzles, investors face a 50% probability of investment loss
- The coordinator will determine success by rolling a die: even numbers indicate success, odd numbers signify failure

**Success Rewards**:
Successful enterprises yield a return of 2.5 times the initial investment. For example, a $40 investment with successful puzzle completion and a favorable die roll would generate a $100 return. All investment returns are distributed at the beginning of the subsequent session.

**Availability Constraint**: A maximum of four Enterprises are available to the society as a collective in any given session.

### Investment Requirements and Returns

| **Size Level** | **Minimum Investment** | **Payoff for Success** |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| One            | $20                    | $50                     |
| Two            | $40                    | $100                    |
| Three          | $60                    | $150                    |
| Four           | $80                    | $200                    |
| Five           | $100                   | $250                    |

**Success Probability**:
- All three puzzles solved = 0.5 (50% chance)
- Fewer than three puzzles solved = 0 (0% chance)

## Basic Groups

The simulation incorporates eight fundamental organizational units: two industries (BASIN and RETSIN), two political parties (POP and SOP), an employee organization (EMPIN), a human services group (HUMSERVE), a mass media group (MASMED), and a judicial council (JUDCO). Each group's objectives, resources, and operational parameters are detailed in subsequent sections.

### Group Assignment Process

Prior to the commencement of the simulation, participants will be asked to indicate their first, second, and third preferences among the eight basic groups. These preferences will be utilized exclusively for the selection of group leaders, not for general membership allocation.

### Employment Dynamics

Participants not designated as group leaders may pursue employment opportunities within one or more basic groups. The following employment principles apply:

- Participants are not obligated to join the group they initially selected on Form A and may seek positions with any group willing to employ them
- Multiple group affiliations are permitted; participants may work for several groups simultaneously
- Group leaders may also hold positions in other groups while maintaining their leadership role
- Ownership of a subsistence or travel agency constitutes employment, though participants may concurrently hold positions within basic groups

### Group Income Structure

Five distinct income levels are established for basic groups, corresponding to Size Levels One through Five. The appropriate income level is determined by the total participant count and will be announced by the coordinator before the simulation begins. This base income level remains constant throughout the simulation.

It should be noted that after the initial session, a group's actual income may fluctuate above or below its base level depending on changes in the National Indicators (see "Consequences of Changes in the National Indicators").

## BASIN (Basic Industry)

### Overall Objective
To expand its assets and income to the maximum extent possible. BASIN represents a fundamental extractive industry analogous to mining operations. Its raw material consists of words, from which it extracts the vowels a, e, i, o, and u.

### Operational Mechanics
- During each session, BASIN may acquire from the coordinator any number of verbal passages up to a maximum of five
- Passages need not be purchased simultaneously; they may be acquired at any point during the session
- BASIN's task involves creating an accurate inventory of each vowel type present in the passage
- All words must be included in the analysis, including author names in references and other textual elements

### Authorization and Procurement
- All passage purchases require authorization from the BASIN head using Form H
- Passage length varies, affecting the labor required for vowel enumeration
- The exact cost of a passage and the compensation for completed work vary according to the society's size level
- BASIN receives a 25% profit on its investment for correctly extracting vowels

### Performance-Based Compensation
- Compensation for completed passages is reduced proportionally to the number of errors in the solution
- Each numerical discrepancy from the correct vowel count constitutes an error
- Each error reduces payment by 16% of the purchase price
- For example, in a Size Level Two society, BASIN would pay $60 for a passage. If a solution contained four errors, the payment would be reduced to $51 ($75 - (4 × $6))
- Solutions containing six or more errors receive no compensation

### Submission Requirements
- Solutions must be submitted to the coordinator using Form H during the same session in which the passage was purchased
- Passages acquired in one session cannot be carried over for completion in subsequent sessions
- Payment for completed passages is disbursed at the conclusion of the session

### Asset Management
- The coordinator maintains records of BASIN's assets
- BASIN head receives 10% interest on assets at the commencement of each new session, including the value of work completed by the end of the previous session
- The actual amount received is affected by National Indicators
- For example, if BASIN's assets were $200 and National Indicators were down by 20%, instead of receiving $20 income, this would be reduced to $16 (80% of $20)
- The BASIN head may withdraw part or all of its assets from the bank at any time by completing Form I

### Resource Acquisition
- BASIN may purchase passages using its banked assets and income derived from these assets
- In the early stages of the simulation, BASIN's assets and income may be insufficient to purchase five passages
- To maximize passage acquisition, BASIN may need to secure additional Simbucks from other individuals and groups
- This may be accomplished through promising returns on investment, persuasive arguments regarding societal benefits, or other incentives

### Effects on National Indicators
The procurement and successful completion of passages by BASIN influences two National Indicators:
- **Standard of Living (SL)**: Increases for each acceptable solution (defined as having fewer than six errors)
- **Food and Energy Supply (FES)**: Decreases for each passage purchased, reflecting the depletion of existing resources

This dynamic creates a trade-off where passage acquisition entails short-term societal costs while simultaneously generating long-term economic growth.

### BASIN Economic Parameters

BASIN's economic parameters scale systematically with the society's size level (SL), following these formulas:

- **Starting Assets**: $50 + ($50 × SL)
- **Initial Income**: $5 + ($5 × SL)
- **Passage Cost**: $20 + ($20 × SL)
- **Payment for Completed Passage**: $25 + ($25 × SL) [25% profit on investment]
- **Error Deduction per Error**: $2 + ($2 × SL) [approximately 16% of purchase price]

For example, in a Size Level Three society:
- Starting Assets: $50 + ($50 × 3) = $200
- Initial Income: $5 + ($5 × 3) = $20
- Passage Cost: $20 + ($20 × 3) = $80
- Payment for Completed Passage: $25 + ($25 × 3) = $100
- Error Deduction: $2 + ($2 × 3) = $8 per error

Note: BASIN receives no payment if a solution contains six or more errors.

## RETSIN (Retail Sales Industry)

### Overall Objective
Like BASIN, RETSIN aims to expand its assets and income to the maximum extent possible. RETSIN represents a manufacturing industry that produces retail goods for export markets. Its market is characterized by greater uncertainty compared to BASIN's. The raw materials for RETSIN consist of anagrams from which it forms smaller marketable words. For each anagram, there are only five marketable words, though RETSIN is not informed which ones have value. The only parameters known are that all marketable words contain exactly five letters, are common English words, and are not proper nouns or plurals.

### Operational Mechanics
- During each session, RETSIN may acquire from the coordinator up to five anagrams
- Anagrams may be purchased at any point during the session
- A completed solution consists of identifying as many marketable five-letter words as possible
- Once a completed anagram has been submitted to the coordinator, it cannot be reclaimed for additional work if some marketable words were missed

### Authorization and Procurement
- All anagram purchases require authorization from the RETSIN head using Form H
- The cost of anagrams and payment for marketable words vary according to the society's size level
- RETSIN receives a 50% profit on its investment if it produces all five marketable words from an anagram

### Performance-Based Compensation
- Payment is proportional to the number of marketable words identified
- RETSIN receives 20% less for each missing word (i.e., 80% for four words, 60% for three, 40% for two, and 20% for one)
- For example, in a Size Level Two society, RETSIN would pay $60 for an anagram. If a solution identifies four marketable words, it would receive $18 for each, totaling $72

### Submission Requirements
- Solutions must be submitted to the coordinator using Form H during the same session in which the anagram was purchased
- Anagrams acquired in one session cannot be carried over for completion in subsequent sessions
- Payment for marketable words is disbursed at the beginning of the following session

### Asset Management
- The coordinator maintains records of RETSIN's assets
- RETSIN head receives 10% interest on assets at the commencement of each new session
- The actual amount received is affected by National Indicators
- The RETSIN head may withdraw part or all of its assets from the bank at any time by completing Form I

### Resource Acquisition
- RETSIN may purchase anagrams using its banked assets and interest from these assets
- In the early stages of the simulation, RETSIN's assets and income may be insufficient to purchase five anagrams
- To maximize anagram acquisition, RETSIN may need to secure additional Simbucks from other individuals and groups through various incentives

### Effects on National Indicators
The production of marketable words from anagrams by RETSIN influences two National Indicators:
- **Standard of Living (SL)**: Increases for each anagram that is converted into one or more marketable words
- **Public Commitment (PC)**: Decreases for completed anagrams, reflecting the privatizing effects of consumer culture

This dynamic illustrates the societal trade-offs inherent in economic development: while anagram processing creates short-term social costs through decreased public commitment, it simultaneously generates long-term economic growth that benefits the society.

### RETSIN Economic Parameters

RETSIN's economic parameters scale systematically with the society's size level (SL), following these formulas:

- **Starting Assets**: $50 + ($50 × SL)
- **Initial Income**: $5 + ($5 × SL)
- **Anagram Cost**: $20 + ($20 × SL)
- **Payment per Word** (all 5 found): ($6 + ($6 × SL)) per word
- **Payment Reduction**: 20% per missing word

For example, in a Size Level Two society:
- Starting Assets: $50 + ($50 × 2) = $150
- Initial Income: $5 + ($5 × 2) = $15
- Anagram Cost: $20 + ($20 × 2) = $60
- Payment per Word (all 5 found): $6 + ($6 × 2) = $18 per word, totaling $90 (50% profit)
- If only 4 words found: $18 × 4 = $72 (20% reduction)

## POP (Party of the People)

### Overall Objective
To determine the major public policies followed by the society and to develop programs and mobilize supporters for this purpose; to be more influential than its rival. When the simulation begins, POP exists as a political party without an established program, philosophy, or ideology. It is the responsibility of POP members to develop these elements according to their assessment of societal needs and citizen beliefs.

### Income Structure

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $20 × SL (Size Level)

For example:
- Size Level One: $20 × 1 = $40
- Size Level Two: $20 × 2 = $60
- Size Level Three: $20 × 3 = $80

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
After the first session, POP's income is determined by the number of Support Cards it receives:

Income = (Number of Support Cards / 40% of society members) × 1.25 × Initial Income

This formula rewards popular support while maintaining a proportional relationship to society size. For example, in a Size Level Two society, if POP received support from 50% of members in the first session:

Income = (50% / 40%) × 1.25 × $60 = 1.25 × 1.25 × $60 = $75

As with all groups, the actual amount received is affected by National Indicators. If indicators were down by 20%, POP would receive $60 (80% of $75).

### Support Card System

- Each individual may submit one Party Support Card per session for either POP or SOP
- Participation is optional; individuals may abstain
- Support Cards must be signed by the individual expressing support
- Cards may be submitted directly or through an intermediary
- Multiple submissions from the same individual invalidate all their cards for that session
- Support Cards from absentees or arrested individuals are invalid

### Operational Flexibility

Political parties may collaborate if desired, and new parties may be established, though these actions do not alter the income distribution mechanisms established by the coordinator. Party members have discretion regarding internal income allocation, provided it complies with simulation rules.

## SOP (Society Party)

### Overall Objective
Identical to POP: to determine major public policies, develop programs, and mobilize supporters to become more influential than its rival.

### Income Structure

SOP's economic parameters mirror those of POP exactly:

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $20 × SL (Size Level)

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
After the first session, SOP's income is calculated using the same formula as POP:

Income = (Number of Support Cards / 40% of society members) × 1.25 × Initial Income

This creates a direct competition between the two parties for citizen support, with identical financial incentives.

## National Indicators

Numerical values for four National Indicators are calculated at the end of each session. These society-wide metrics measure societal health:

**Food and Energy Supply (FES)**:
- Measures society's adaptation to physical environment
- Are natural resources being developed and replenished to meet population needs?
- Higher score = abundant resources

**Standard of Living (SL)**:
- Measures consumption level and quality of life
- How well are citizens living at present?
- Higher score = better living conditions

**Social Cohesion (SC)**:
- Measures integration between different citizen groups
- How well are citizens working together across regional and group boundaries?
- Higher score = stronger social bonds

**Public Commitment (PC)**:
- Measures dedication to collective welfare and public good
- Are citizens invested in community well-being beyond self-interest?
- Higher score = stronger civic engagement

## EMPIN (Employee Interests)

### Overall Objective
To ensure that members of the society who are not heads of basic groups have adequate subsistence and a fair share of the society's wealth. EMPIN may organize society members working for various basic groups and may propose programs for the society as a whole that would meet EMPIN's objectives. Collaboration with other groups may be advantageous in pursuing these goals.

### Income Structure

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $15 × SL + $15

For example:
- Size Level One: ($15 × 1) + $15 = $30
- Size Level Two: ($15 × 2) + $15 = $45
- Size Level Three: ($15 × 3) + $15 = $60

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
After the first session, EMPIN's income is determined by membership support:

Income = 2 × Number of valid EMPIN Membership Cards

For example, if 25 members submitted valid EMPIN Membership Cards during a session, EMPIN would receive $50 for the next session. As with all groups, the actual amount received is affected by National Indicators. If indicators were down by 20%, EMPIN would receive $40 (80% of $50).

### Membership Card System

- Each individual may submit one EMPIN Membership Card per session
- Participation is optional; individuals may abstain
- Membership Cards must be signed by the individual member
- Cards may be submitted directly or through an intermediary
- Multiple submissions from the same individual count as only one membership
- Membership cards from absentees or arrested individuals are invalid

### Additional Funding
EMPIN may solicit additional funds from society members if desired.

## HUMSERVE (Human Services)

### Overall Objective
To ensure that the human needs of individuals in the society are being met as effectively as possible. HUMSERVE may provide services addressing physical, social, or emotional needs of participants and may promote programs for the society as a whole to better meet human needs. Collaboration with other groups may be beneficial in pursuing these objectives.

### Income Structure

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $15 × SL + $15

For example:
- Size Level One: ($15 × 1) + $15 = $30
- Size Level Two: ($15 × 2) + $15 = $45
- Size Level Three: ($15 × 3) + $15 = $60

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
After the first session, HUMSERVE's income is determined by support cards:

Income = 2 × Number of valid HUMSERVE Support Cards

For example, if 25 members submitted valid HUMSERVE Support Cards during a session, HUMSERVE would receive $50 for the next session. As with all groups, the actual amount received is affected by National Indicators. If indicators were down by 20%, HUMSERVE would receive $40 (80% of $50).

### Support Card System

- Each individual may submit one HUMSERVE Support Card per session
- Participation is optional; individuals may abstain
- Support Cards must be signed by the individual member
- Cards may be submitted directly or through an intermediary
- Multiple submissions from the same individual count as only one support
- Support cards from absentees or arrested individuals are invalid

### Additional Funding
HUMSERVE may solicit additional funds from society members if desired.

## MASMED (Mass Media)

### Overall Objective
To ensure effective communication across regions about developments within the society. While MASMED does not possess a monopoly over communication, it enjoys certain advantages and information access that facilitate its specialized role. The predominant form of communication in the simulation is face-to-face interaction as participants travel between regions. To enhance MASMED's communicative capacity, its head receives a Private Transportation Certificate and an initial supply of five travel tickets.

### Communication Media

The specific communication technologies available to MASMED will be determined by the coordinator based on available technical facilities. Potential options include:

1. **Closed-circuit Television**: Broadcasts originating exclusively from MASMED with reception in all regions
2. **Videotape Transmission**: Recordings available only through MASMED but viewable in all regions, with distribution limited to two tapes per session
3. **One-way Intercom**: Broadcasts originating only from MASMED but receivable in all regions
4. **One-way Computer Transmission**: Sending capability exclusive to MASMED with receiving terminals in all regions
5. **Hard Copy Distribution**: Word processor or typewriter transmission available only through MASMED, limited to two transmissions per session
6. **Cell Phones**: Available for the MASMED head and up to three reporters to communicate with their headquarters while traveling to other regions

### Information Access

After each session, MASMED receives exclusive information from the coordinator including:
- Current values of National Indicators
- Rates of absenteeism, unemployment, arrests, and deaths
- Total number of POP and SOP cards, EMPIN memberships, HUMSERVE cards, and MASMED subscriptions
- Individual Goal Declarations submitted during the session

This information may be used by MASMED as desired, though official forms filed by individuals remain confidential unless the filing person grants permission for disclosure.

### Income Structure

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $15 × SL + $15

For example:
- Size Level One: ($15 × 1) + $15 = $30
- Size Level Two: ($15 × 2) + $15 = $45
- Size Level Three: ($15 × 3) + $15 = $60

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
After the first session, MASMED's income is determined by subscription support:

Income = 2 × Number of valid MASMED Subscriptions

For example, if 25 members submitted valid MASMED Subscriptions during a session, MASMED would receive $50 for the next session. As with all groups, the actual amount received is affected by National Indicators. If indicators were down by 20%, MASMED would receive $40 (80% of $50).

### Subscription System

- Each individual may submit one MASMED Subscription per session
- Participation is optional; individuals may abstain
- Subscriptions must be signed by the individual subscriber
- Subscriptions may be submitted directly or through an intermediary
- Multiple submissions from the same individual count as only one subscription
- Subscriptions from absentees, persons under arrest, or those without subsistence are invalid

### Resource Summary

- One permanent Transportation Certificate
- Five Travel Tickets (initial session only)
- Special access to information on National Indicators, support card totals, and Individual Goal Declarations
- Communication capabilities through various media as determined by the coordinator
- Two distributions of videotape or hard copy per session
- Up to four cell phones for communication between headquarters and traveling reporters
- Income based on subscriptions after the first session

### Additional Funding
MASMED may solicit additional funds from society members or charge for its services if desired.

## JUDCO (Judicial Council)

### Overall Objective
To clarify and interpret the rules as honestly and conscientiously as possible. JUDCO members may be called upon to adjudicate various issues, including:

1. Whether an action or prospective action by a member or group violates the basic rules of the simulation
2. Whether an agreement among society members violates any basic rule of the simulation

JUDCO may act when an action or agreement is challenged. It serves as the final arbiter on the meaning and interpretation of all rules, and the coordinator may refer questions to JUDCO for clarification.

### Interpretive Principles

JUDCO members should approach ambiguous situations in good faith rather than using ingenuity to circumvent basic rules. The coordinator will accept JUDCO's judgment even if it differs from their own interpretation, but arbitrary and capricious interpretations can undermine the simulation's purpose. If JUDCO's interpretations remove the "natural constraints" that the rules are intended to simulate, the dilemmas posed by the simulation will disappear—along with its educational value.

### Operational Rules

1. To be valid, JUDCO decisions must be signed by a simple majority of its members and filed on Form J
2. JUDCO must have at least two members besides its head, with total membership maintained as an odd number

### Income Structure

**Initial Income Formula**:
- First Session Income: $15 × SL + $15

For example:
- Size Level One: ($15 × 1) + $15 = $30
- Size Level Two: ($15 × 2) + $15 = $45
- Size Level Three: ($15 × 3) + $15 = $60

**Subsequent Sessions Income Formula**:
JUDCO's income in subsequent sessions is affected by National Indicators. For example, if National Indicators were down by 20% in a Size Level Three society, instead of receiving $60 income, JUDCO would receive $48 (80% of $60).

## National Indicators Calculation

National Indicators are calculated at the end of each session based on various activities and decisions made during the session:

1. **BASIN Activities**: Passage purchases decrease Food and Energy Supply; successful solutions increase Standard of Living

2. **RETSIN Activities**: Anagram solutions increase Standard of Living; completed anagrams decrease Public Commitment

3. **Support Card Distribution**: Balanced support across groups increases Social Cohesion; concentrated support decreases it

4. **Resource Distribution**: Equitable distribution increases Public Commitment; concentration of wealth decreases it

5. **Inter-regional Cooperation**: Collaborative projects increase Social Cohesion; regional isolation decreases it

Indicator values affect group incomes in the subsequent session, creating feedback loops that encourage participants to consider long-term societal health alongside immediate group interests.

## Simforce

Physical force, or its threat, plays a significant role in all societies. While actual physical force is prohibited within SIMSOC (participants cannot physically restrain others or use force against them), the simulation incorporates a mechanism that represents the equivalent of physical force within the game environment. The Simforce system provides a structured way to represent power dynamics without requiring actual physical confrontation.

### Establishing a Simforce

Any individual or group may establish a Simforce by completing Form L and submitting it to the coordinator with the minimum creation cost of $25. This creates a Simforce with an initial size of 25 units, representing the direct conversion of the 25 Simbucks initialization cost. The form must include an unambiguous authorization rule specifying who can issue orders for the Simforce. This rule can take any form (e.g., "Orders require a two-thirds majority," "Orders must be signed by specific individuals," etc.).

A Simforce's size can be increased by investing additional Simbucks, with each Simbuck spent increasing the force by exactly 1 unit. This direct 1:1 relationship between investment and size provides a clear metric for measuring a Simforce's power.

Once established, a Simforce must be renewed each session or it will be considered defunct. The renewal fee is $10 per session, regardless of force size. This maintenance fee does not increase the Simforce's size, which can only be expanded by the direct investment of additional Simbucks.

Each Simforce must designate a head whose powers are governed by the authorization rule specified at creation. The Simforce head receives all confiscated possessions from arrested individuals and serves as the communication link with the coordinator. If the designated head is absent during a session and no authorized individual is present to issue replacement orders, the Simforce becomes dormant for that session. If the head returns in subsequent sessions, the Simforce may be renewed with its original powers intact.

### Core Powers of a Simforce

A Simforce possesses three fundamental powers:

1. **To arrest individuals**
2. **To protect individuals from arrest**
3. **To attack another Simforce**

#### Arrest Procedures

An arrest is initiated by completing Form L, which requires an existing Simforce. Each arrest incurs a $10 fee paid to the bank. The coordinator executes the arrest order unless the target is protected by another Simforce. If an arrest cannot be carried out due to protection, the Simforce head is notified, but the arrest fee is not refunded.

Arrests of unprotected individuals take effect as soon as the coordinator can process the order and last for the duration of the session. The coordinator informs arrested individuals of their status, and all personal possessions (Simbucks, subsistence and travel tickets) are confiscated. For arrested BASIN or RETSIN heads, only their personal Simbucks are affected, not those held in coordinator-managed bank accounts.

The coordinator does not reveal the identity of the arresting Simforce unless specifically requested to do so by the Simforce head. All confiscated possessions are transferred to the Simforce head.

An arrested individual may be released at any time by order of the arresting Simforce. The return of confiscated materials upon release is handled internally by the Simforce and is not governed by the rules. At the beginning of each session following an arrest, the Simforce head must inform the coordinator whether to renew existing arrests or release those under arrest. Renewals require a payment of $10 per arrested person per session. The coordinator informs arrested individuals of their status for the session.

All arrested individuals are automatically and immediately released if the arresting Simforce is removed.

#### Restrictions on Arrested Individuals

Individuals under arrest:
1. Are confined to their home region and prohibited from travel
2. Cannot hold any official position (including in basic groups or agencies)
3. May not engage in official transactions with the coordinator (submitting forms, investing Simbucks, etc.)
4. Must surrender all Simbucks, subsistence and travel tickets in their possession at the time of arrest
5. Receive subsistence while under arrest, but if released during a session must provide their own subsistence
6. Retain ownership of Luxury Living Endowments and Private Transportation Certificates but cannot use them while arrested
7. Have their POP and SOP support cards, EMPIN and HUMSERVE cards, MASMED Subscriptions, and Individual Goal Declarations invalidated during arrest
8. Are considered deceased if their arrests are renewed twice consecutively and can no longer participate in the simulation

#### Fines System

A Simforce may establish a schedule of fines for specific actions, but the coordinator does not act as the collection agent. If fines are assessed and individuals refuse to pay, the matter must be resolved by the participants themselves, potentially through additional arrest actions. The collection of fines is entirely the responsibility of the participants and is not managed by the coordinator.

#### Protection from Arrest

Any individual under the protection of a Simforce cannot be arrested until the protecting Simforce is removed. All individuals authorized to sign orders for a Simforce (as specified on Form L) are automatically considered protected. Additionally, the Simforce may extend protection to other individuals by indicating this on Form L. For protection to be effective, it must be established before the coordinator informs an individual of their arrest.

#### Attacking and Removing Another Simforce

A Simforce may be eliminated through an attack by another, larger Simforce. An attack is initiated by filing an attack order on Form L and is successful only if:

1. The target is correctly identified by the name of its official head
2. The attacking Simforce is at least $25 larger than the target force

If an attack succeeds, the coordinator notifies the attacker and informs the head of the now-defunct Simforce that their force is no longer operational. The attacking Simforce is reduced in size by an amount equal to 50% of the size of the Simforce that was eliminated.

The coordinator does not disclose the size of any Simforce or the identity of its official head. If an attack fails because the head was incorrectly identified, the attacking Simforce head is charged $10. If an attack fails because the attacking force is insufficient in size, it is reduced by 50% of its current size, and the head is informed. The head of the Simforce that was targeted is notified of the unsuccessful attack but is not told the identity of the attacker.

For example, if a Simforce of size $70 attacks a Simforce of size $50 and correctly identifies the head, the attack fails because the attacking force is not $25 larger than the target. The unsuccessful attack reduces the attacking force by 50% to $35.

Once an attack order is filed with the coordinator, neither the attacking Simforce nor the target Simforce may be enlarged while the attack is in progress.

**Indicator Mechanics**:
- All indicators start at 100 for first session
- Natural decline of 10% each session (entropy)
- Any indicator reaching zero = society collapse and game over
- If the National Indicators decline below certain points, the income available to the basic groups in the society declines
- If the National Indicators rise above certain points, the income available to the basic groups increases
- Effects calculated at end of each session

## Riots and Guard Posts

### Simforce Impact on National Indicators

There is no expectation that a Simforce will necessarily be created during the simulation. It is only a possible option, and the society may end up with several Simforces, one, or none at all, depending on the decisions of its members.

Arrests affect the National Indicators as follows: For every individual who is arrested, Public Commitment and Social Cohesion are each reduced by three units.

### Simriot Mechanics

Members of the society may participate in riots by signing a Simriot Form (Form M). Each individual may sign only one riot form in any given session. If more than one is signed, all signatures by that individual on riot forms will be considered invalid.

Important considerations for riots include:

1. **Riot Activation**: A riot does not occur until and unless the riot form is presented to the coordinator. The existence of a signed riot form does not guarantee that a riot will actually occur.

2. **Signature Validity**: Signatures on riot forms are valid only for the session in which they are signed.

3. **Participation Restrictions**: Individuals under arrest cannot participate in riots.

#### Effects of Riots on National Indicators

Riots have measurable impacts on National Indicators:

1. **Public Commitment**: Decreases by 2 units for each rioter participating.

2. **Social Cohesion**: Decreases according to the percentage of the total population participating in riots, as follows:

   | Percentage of Rioters | Social Cohesion Impact |
   |----------------------|------------------------|
   | 5%                   | 0                      |
   | 10%                  | -2                     |
   | 15%                  | -6                     |
   | 20%                  | -12                    |
   | 25%                  | -20                    |
   | 30% or more          | -30                    |

### Preventing Riots

Any individual may prevent riots by establishing guard posts in specific regions:

1. **Establishment Cost**: By payment of a fee of $20, any participant may place a guard post in any designated region.

2. **Indication**: The posting of a guard will be indicated by the coordinator placing a Guard Post Form (Form N) in a visible location in the designated region.

3. **Duration**: The guard post is valid only for the session in which it is posted, but the original poster has the option of renewing it at the beginning of each session for a fee of $5 per session.

4. **Effect on Riots**: The presence of a guard post in a region makes it impossible for a riot to occur there.

5. **Social Cohesion Impact**: Each guard post reduces Social Cohesion by 5 units.

6. **Riot Form Invalidation**: Signatures on a riot form will be considered invalid if a guard post is in effect in the region at the time a riot form for that region is filed with the coordinator.

## Government

There is no requirement that the society establish a government, and it may wish to operate without one. If members wish to form a government, they may do so at any time. If a government is created, its supporters may organize and conduct it in any manner they choose. There are no formal rules regulating such a government.

### Government Formation

A government may be established through various means:

1. **Voluntary Association**: Any group of participants may declare themselves a government and seek support from others.

2. **Electoral Process**: Participants may organize elections to determine government leadership.

3. **Consensus Building**: A government may emerge through negotiation and agreement among various groups.

### Government Powers

Any powers a government possesses are derived solely from the voluntary compliance of society members. Potential government functions might include:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Coordinating the distribution of resources and income.

2. **Dispute Resolution**: Providing mechanisms for resolving conflicts between individuals or groups.

3. **Public Programs**: Organizing and funding initiatives to address societal needs.

4. **Crisis Management**: Responding to challenges such as indicator declines or riots.

### Government Limitations

Governments in SIMSOC face inherent limitations:

1. **Enforcement**: No automatic enforcement mechanisms exist; compliance is voluntary.

2. **Authority**: Government authority extends only as far as participants are willing to recognize it.

3. **Competition**: Multiple competing governments may exist simultaneously.

4. **Dissolution**: Governments may dissolve at any time if support wanes.

## Special Events (Optional)

Sometime during SIMSOC, the coordinator may announce the occurrence of certain outside events affecting the society. You will not know in advance when such an event will occur or what its nature is. These events are mentioned here so that you realize that they are part of the game and not an arbitrary intervention by the coordinator.

Special events may include:

1. **External Crises**: Natural disasters, economic shocks, or other external pressures that affect resource availability or National Indicators.

2. **Technological Developments**: New capabilities that alter the functioning of certain groups or create new opportunities.

3. **Population Changes**: Sudden increases or decreases in population that affect resource distribution and group dynamics.

4. **External Relations**: Interactions with other simulated societies that may present opportunities for trade, conflict, or cooperation.

When special events occur, the coordinator will provide all necessary information about their effects on the simulation. Participants are expected to adapt to these changes as they would to any other development within the society.

## Absenteeism

Certain National Indicators are lowered when members are absent, regardless of the reason for the absence.

## Group Head Dynamics

### Powers and Employment Authority

Individuals are not officially considered employed by a group until the head of that group has filed a Job Schedule (Form G) listing them as employees. Employment status is presumed to persist between sessions unless circumstances alter an individual's employment status. Group heads are not required to file additional Job Schedules after the initial filing unless they wish to modify employment arrangements, in which case they must submit a new Job Schedule detailing the nature of the changes.

Employment requires explicit consent; no individual may be employed without their consent, and any individual may terminate their employment by submitting a notice of resignation on the Job Schedule. Agreements regarding salary and working conditions constitute internal matters between group heads and their employees and need not be reported to the coordinator.

### Replacement Mechanisms

#### Voluntary Removal
The head of a group may resign at any time and appoint a successor of their choice by completing the appropriate section of the Job Schedule (Form G).

#### Involuntary Removal
Heads of groups are automatically removed from office under the following conditions:
- Failure to provide subsistence
- Arrest
- Absence

Additionally, a group head may be removed by unanimous consent of all employees present at that session. However, this unanimous consent provision is subject to the qualification that removal cannot occur if fewer than two official employees are present.

### Designation of New Group Head

The process for designating a new group head varies depending on whether the removal was voluntary or involuntary:

#### After Voluntary Removal
The departing head may simply designate a successor.

#### After Involuntary Removal
Three distinct scenarios determine the succession process:

1. **No Other Employees or All Absent**: The coordinator selects a new head at random from the same region in which the former head resided

2. **Single Employee Present**: This employee automatically becomes the new head

3. **Multiple Employees Present**: They select a new head by simple majority vote. If no employee receives a majority, the group remains without a head for that session, and the coordinator selects a new head for the following session at random from among the employees

The Job Schedule (Form G) serves as the official document for all transactions regarding the removal and replacement of group heads.

## Mergers and Alliances

Groups may form various alliances and arrangements with each other, including mergers, federations, and similar cooperative structures. All such agreements constitute internal matters among members of the society and do not involve coordinator transactions. 

For example, if two groups join together to create a new group, the coordinator will continue to provide any resources to which individuals are entitled under the rules. The individuals are then free to pool these resources or not as they choose.

## Collective Life

### National Indicators

Numerical values for four National Indicators are calculated by the coordinator at the end of each session as one means of measuring the general effectiveness and "health" of the society as a whole. Each indicator pertains to a different aspect of the society:

1. **Food and Energy Supply (FES)**: Represents how well the society is adapting to its physical environment. Is it developing its natural resources to meet the needs of its population? Is it replenishing the resources it consumes? A higher score means an abundant Food and Energy Supply.

2. **Standard of Living (SL)**: Represents the consumption level of the society. How well are the citizens of the society living at the present time? A higher score means a higher Standard of Living.

3. **Social Cohesion (SC)**: Represents how well different groups of citizens are integrated. Are some groups isolated and left out? Are there destructive conflicts between subgroups? The higher the score on Social Cohesion, the less the presence of destructive intergroup conflict.

4. **Public Commitment (PC)**: Represents the degree of commitment by citizens of the society to its social structure and values. Are there large numbers of alienated citizens who feel estranged from the society and do not participate in it in a constructive way? The higher the score on Public Commitment, the less the degree of alienation among the citizens.

## Public Programs

The National Indicators may be raised by investing money in either of two broad Public Programs. The money is invested by giving it to the bank with the instruction that it be used for a specific Public Program. This money is "used up" in the Public Program—that is, once invested it cannot later be withdrawn from the bank.

The programs are:

1. **Research and Conservation**: The purpose of this program is to promote scientific research and activity in such areas as (a) developing and conserving the natural environment so as to increase the Food and Energy Supply, and (b) utilizing available manpower resources more effectively so as to raise the overall Standard of Living.

2. **Welfare Services**: This program creates and expands a variety of Welfare Services for the citizens of the society and thus copes with poverty, discontent, social unrest, and so forth. Investments in this program help to raise the Standard of Living as well as Social Cohesion and Public Commitment.

Any individual or group can invest any amount of money in either or both of these programs. The specific effects of these investments on the four National Indicators of Food and Energy Supply, Standard of Living, Social Cohesion, and Public Commitment are discussed in the Changes in the National Indicators section.

Any individual or group may decide to aid the society by advising its members on investment policies, work organization, or other matters which may indirectly affect any of the National Indicators, and thus contribute to the overall vitality and effectiveness of the society.

## Changes in the National Indicators

Each National Indicator begins at 100 for the first session. Many of the actions that influence different indicators are summarized below:

1. **Spontaneous Decline**: Each indicator automatically declines by 10% between sessions to represent a spontaneous decay factor.

2. **Public Programs**: Simbucks invested in the two programs described above raise the National Indicators; however, these programs have "administrative costs," so that a Simbuck invested in them does not bring an equivalent rise in the National Indicators.

   a. **Research and Conservation**: This program raises the Food and Energy Supply (FES) by 40% of the value of all new money invested in it and the Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of the value of all new money invested in it.

   b. **Welfare Services**: This program raises the Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of the value of all new money invested in it and Social Cohesion (SC) and Public Commitment (PC) by 20% of the value of all new money invested in it.

3. **Industrial Production**: Each passage purchased by BASIN lowers FES by two units, but each passage completed raises SL by 1 unit. Each anagram invested in by RETSIN raises SL by 1 unit but lowers PC by 1 unit.

4. **Absenteeism**: Each absentee lowers SL and PC both by 2 units.

5. **Unemployment**: Each unemployed person lowers SL and SC by 3 units and PC by 1 unit.

6. **Riots and Guard Posts**: Each rioter lowers PC by 2 units and SC by varying amounts. Each guard post lowers Social Cohesion by 5 units.

7. **Arrests**: Each arrest lowers SC and PC by 3 units.

8. **Deaths**: Each death lowers SL, SC, and PC by 5 units.

9. **Individual Goal Declarations**: Every four positive individual goal declarations ("Yes, I'm satisfied") raise PC by 1 unit; each negative declaration ("No, I'm not satisfied") lowers PC by one unit. Any declaration of change in individual goals leaves PC unaffected.

### Maximum Decline

No National Indicator will be lowered by more than 30 units in a single session for any single cause, although there is no limit to the size of decline from a combination of causes. 

For example, if seven members were to die in a single session, SL, SC, and PC would be lowered only by 30 units rather than by 35. However, these indicators might also be lowered additionally by absenteeism, arrests, etc.

### Effects of Investment and Other Actions on National Indicators

**Public Programs:**
- Research and Conservation: +40% FES, +10% SL of invested amount
- Welfare Services: +10% SL, +20% SC, +20% PC of invested amount

**Industrial Activities:**
- Each BASIN Passage: -2 FES (when purchased), +1 SL (when completed)
- Each RETSIN Anagram: +1 SL, -1 PC

**Social Factors:**
- Each Absentee: -2 SL, -2 PC
- Each Unemployed Person: -3 SL, -3 SC, -1 PC
- Each Rioter: -2 PC, variable SC reduction
- Each Guard Post: -5 SC
- Each Arrested Person: -3 SC, -3 PC
- Each Death: -5 SL, -5 SC, -5 PC
- Individual Goal Declarations: +1 PC for every 4 positive declarations, -1 PC for each negative declaration

This means that if, for example, $10 were invested in Research and Conservation, FES would rise by 40% of this or by four units. Similarly, SL would go up by 10% while SC and PC would not be affected.

## Consequences of Changes in the National Indicators

The basic income which group heads receive at the beginning of each session is affected by the state of the National Indicators. More specifically:

1. If all four of the National Indicators are at 120 or above at the beginning of a session, basic income will be increased by 20% for that session.

2. If any of the four National Indicators is below 90, basic income will be reduced by 10%; if any is below 80, income will be reduced by 20%; if any is below 70, income will be reduced by 30%; and so forth, down to 90% less for any session in which any of the national Indicators is below 10. Note that this affects in the same way the income which BASIN and RETSIN receive, although their assets in the bank are not affected by the National Indicators.

3. The society ends if any National Indicator falls below zero.

## Absenteeism

For every member of the society who is absent from any session, regardless of reason, Standard of Living and Public Commitment are each reduced by two units. Absentees are not required to supply subsistence for sessions which they miss, and therefore do not suffer the consequences of subsistence failure for the following session.

If heads of basic groups or agencies are absent, they are automatically removed from office and a new head is designated in the manner provided in the rules. Employees of the group continue to hold their positions while absent unless they are removed by the head. Members are not considered absent if they are present for any part of a session.

For any session in which there are five or more absentees (but fewer than ten), one subsistence agency chosen at random will not receive its allotment of subsistence tickets. For any session in which there are ten or more absentees, two subsistence agencies chosen at random will not receive their allotment of subsistence tickets.

## Unemployment

Unemployment can result from any of five sources:

1. **Employer Action**: You may be fired, or no one may be willing to hire you.
2. **Employee Action**: You may resign from all your positions.
3. **Subsistence Failure**: Failure to obtain subsistence means automatic unemployment.
4. **Arrest**: Arrest means automatic unemployment (see discussion of Simforce below).
5. **Minority Group Action**: If the Minority Group option is in effect, some Minority Group Members may become unemployed by having a Minority Group Action (Form K) filed against them (see discussion in section below).

For each unemployed person in a given session, Standard of Living and Social Cohesion will each be lowered by three units, and Public Commitment will be lowered by one unit. (This does not include unemployment due to arrest, the effects of which on the indicators are already included.)

## Death

Participants may die from failure to obtain subsistence in two consecutive sessions or from having their arrest renewed for two consecutive sessions (the second renewal is equivalent to execution). Members who die cannot henceforth participate in the society in any way; they will be asked to observe and assist the coordinator.

Each death, regardless of cause, lowers Standard of Living, Social Cohesion, and Public Commitment by five units each.

## Public Programs

Two programs available to raise National Indicators through investment:

**Research and Conservation**:
- **Purpose**: Promote scientific research and environmental conservation
- **Effects**: 
  - Raises Food and Energy Supply (FES) by 40% of investment
  - Raises Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of investment
- **Investment**: Any individual or group can invest any amount
- **Permanence**: Money invested cannot be withdrawn ("used up")

**Welfare Services**:
- **Purpose**: Address poverty, discontent, and social unrest
- **Effects**:
  - Raises Standard of Living (SL) by 10% of investment
  - Raises Social Cohesion (SC) by 20% of investment  
  - Raises Public Commitment (PC) by 20% of investment
- **Investment**: Any individual or group can invest any amount
- **Permanence**: Money invested cannot be withdrawn ("used up")

| **Each Arrest** | 0 | 0 | -3 units | -3 units |
| **Each Guard Post** | 0 | 0 | -5 units | 0 |
| **Each Rioter** | 0 | 0 | variable | -2 units |
| **Natural Decline (per session)** | -10% | -10% | -10% | -10% |

## Minority Group Dynamics (Optional)

At the coordinator's discretion, up to 20% of participants may be designated as members of a minority group at the simulation's start. These participants wear identifying markers to distinguish them from the majority population.

### Structural Limitations

- Any pair of majority members can remove a minority member from leadership or employment by submitting Form K
- When removed from leadership, standard succession protocols apply for replacement
- Minority members keep all personal assets and resources when removed from positions
- Removal affects only organizational roles, not personal property or resources

### Recovery and Restrictions

- Removed minority members can seek new positions in subsequent sessions
- During the session of removal, they cannot hold any organizational position
- They remain vulnerable to repeated removal in future sessions
- The coordinator may implement additional systemic challenges

### Alternative Implementation

Instead of designated minority status, the coordinator may institute a qualification test where only those who pass can hold leadership positions, creating a merit-based stratification system.

## Individual Goals

In addition to pursuing basic group goals and various societal goals, individuals are asked to pursue personal or individual goals. An individual goal emphasizes something for you as an individual (for example, being powerful) rather than a goal for the society (for example, making SIMSOC a place where people trust each other).

### Possible Personal Goals

1. **Power**: Influencing what happens in the society as much as possible
2. **Center of attention**: Being a central figure in the life of the society, salient to as many people as possible
3. **Style of life**: Enjoying the highest standard of living available, including as many Munchies as possible
4. **Security**: Leading a life free from threats of subsistence lack, job loss, arrest, or other misfortunes
5. **Popularity**: Being loved and admired as much as possible
6. **Fun and adventure**: Leading an exciting life filled with adventure and challenge
7. **Other**: Participants may specify other individual goals

### Individual Goal Declaration

Each individual may submit one Goal Declaration Card per session, choosing one of the following three answers to the question: "Are you satisfied with how well you are meeting your personal goals?"

1. Yes, I'm satisfied
2. No, I'm not satisfied
3. I've changed my individual goals as follows: (specify the nature of the change)

Participants have the option of not submitting any Individual Goal Declaration. Unlike other forms of support cards, Individual Goal Declarations must be given directly to the coordinator and cannot be submitted through an intermediary.

No more than one option may be checked, and no more than one declaration turned in per session, or all declarations from that individual will be considered invalid for that session.

### Effects on National Indicators

Public Commitment is raised by one unit for every four persons submitting a positive Goal Declaration, and is lowered by one unit for each negative declaration. Abstentions or changes in goals do not affect Public Commitment.

### Arrest and Asset Seizure
- A person who is arrested is restricted to their region and may not travel
- May not hold any job or official position in the society
- May not engage in any official transactions with the coordinator
- Will have all possessions confiscated
- All confiscated materials will be turned over to the head of the Simforce
- A person is dead if their arrest is renewed for two consecutive sessions

### Additional Rules
- More than one Simforce can be created
- It is possible to remove an existing Simforce
- Arrests lower certain National Indicators
- Cannot act without authorization from the governing body
- Must follow established procedures for arrests
- Cannot be used to violate the core game rules

## Simriot

Members of the society may riot by signing a riot form (Form M). Riots may be prevented, however, by the placing of a guard post. Riots lower certain National Indicators.

## Government

There is no requirement that the society establish a government nor are there any formal rules regulating a government.

## Special Events (Optional)

The coordinator may announce the occurrence of certain "outside events" affecting the society, but you will not know in advance when the events will occur or what their nature will be.

## The Object of the Game

To achieve the individual goals you have set for yourself, to help the basic group to which you belong to achieve its goals, and to see to it that the society as a whole is a "success"—however you may choose to define this. If you try to achieve these objectives, the larger objective of learning will be achieved.

## Session Structure

The SIMSOC simulation is organized into discrete sessions, each representing a complete cycle of societal activity. Understanding the structure and flow of these sessions is essential for effective participation.

### Session Components

**Duration Parameters**:
- Each session typically lasts 60-90 minutes total
- Within sessions, activity occurs in continuous flow rather than discrete turns
- The coordinator may announce time markers at 20-30 minute intervals to help participants track progress

### Session Commencement

**Opening Procedures**:
1. **Regional Return**: All participants must return to their home regions at the start of each session
2. **Subsistence Verification**: The coordinator confirms that all participants from the previous session have met their subsistence requirements
3. **Income Distribution**: Basic group heads receive their income for the session, adjusted based on National Indicators
4. **Agency Allocation**: Travel and subsistence agency owners receive their ticket allotments
5. **Enterprise Returns**: Payouts from successful enterprises from the previous session are distributed

**First Session Special Rules**:
- Initial group assignments are announced
- Starting assets are distributed to BASIN and RETSIN
- National Indicators begin at 100 units each
- Basic groups receive their full base income regardless of indicator status

### Mid-Session Activities

**Continuous Operations**:
- Participants may engage in all permitted activities throughout the session
- The coordinator processes forms and transactions as they are submitted
- Travel between regions may occur at any time for authorized individuals
- Communication and negotiation constitute the primary activities

**Coordinator Functions**:
- Maintaining the bank and processing financial transactions
- Receiving and processing forms
- Executing Simforce orders
- Providing passages and anagrams to BASIN and RETSIN
- Tracking National Indicator changes

### Session Conclusion

**Closing Procedures**:
1. **Form Submission Deadline**: The coordinator announces the final call for forms and transactions
2. **Subsistence Verification**: Participants must present subsistence tickets if not already recorded
3. **Support Card Collection**: Final collection of all support cards, membership cards, and subscriptions
4. **National Indicator Calculation**: The coordinator calculates changes to all indicators
5. **Status Announcements**: Unemployment, arrests, and other status changes are confirmed

**Between-Session Mechanics**:
- National Indicators automatically decline by 10% between sessions
- Participants who failed to obtain subsistence become unemployed
- Absentees are recorded and their effects on indicators calculated
- BASIN and RETSIN receive interest on their assets
- Moving requests take effect, changing participants' home regions

### Special Timing Considerations

**Deadline-Sensitive Activities**:
- Industrial transactions (BASIN passages and RETSIN anagrams) must be completed within the same session they are initiated
- Enterprises must be resolved before the session ends or the investment is forfeited
- Arrest orders remain in effect until the end of the session unless explicitly revoked
- Support cards and other submissions are only valid for the session in which they are submitted

**Continuous Elements**:
- Simforce protection extends across sessions if renewed
- Employment status persists between sessions unless altered
- Ownership of agencies, certificates, and endowments continues across sessions
- Regional assignments remain constant until formal moving procedures are completed

## Forms Reference

The following forms are used throughout the SIMSOC simulation to facilitate various processes and transactions. This reference summarizes the purpose and use of each form mentioned in these rules.

### Basic Administrative Forms

**Form A: Initial Preference Form**  
Used by all participants at simulation start to indicate first, second, and third preferences among the eight basic groups.

**Form F: Transfer Form**  
Used to transfer ownership of agencies, certificates, or endowments between participants.

**Form G: Job Schedule**  
Submitted by group heads to list employees and establish employment status.

### Economic Forms

**Form D: Private Transportation Certificate**  
Purchased for $25 to authorize unlimited travel between regions for the remainder of the simulation.

**Form E: Luxury Living Endowment**  
Purchased for $25 to provide subsistence for all future sessions.

**Form H: Industrial Transaction**  
Used by BASIN and RETSIN heads to authorize passage/anagram purchases and record solutions.

**Form I: Asset Withdrawal**  
Submitted by BASIN and RETSIN heads to authorize withdrawal of assets from the bank.

### Governance and Security Forms

**Form J: JUDCO Decision**  
Used by JUDCO members to record official interpretations and decisions.

**Form K: Minority Group Action**  
Submitted by any two non-minority members to remove minority group members from positions.

**Form L: Simforce Action**  
Multi-purpose form used by Simforce heads to create a Simforce, issue arrest orders, establish protection, or attack other Simforces.

**Form M: Simriot Form**  
Used by participants to declare participation in a riot. Each individual may sign only one riot form per session.

**Form N: Guard Post Form**  
Submitted with a $20 fee to establish a guard post in a designated region for one session.

**Form R: Riot Declaration**  
Used by any group of three or more participants to declare an organized protest/riot.

Note: The exact format and detailed instructions for each form are provided in the Coordinator's Manual. This reference is intended only as a summary of form functions within the simulation.

## Conclusion

SIMSOC provides a dynamic environment for exploring social processes and collective decision-making. The rules outlined in this document establish the framework within which participants interact, but the actual development of the society depends entirely on the choices, negotiations, and relationships that emerge during play.

Successful participation in SIMSOC requires:

1. **Understanding the Rules**: Familiarity with the basic mechanics of subsistence, income, and group functions
2. **Strategic Thinking**: Considering both short-term personal goals and long-term societal health
3. **Communication Skills**: Effectively negotiating, forming alliances, and resolving conflicts
4. **Adaptability**: Responding to changing conditions, indicator shifts, and unexpected events
5. **Critical Analysis**: Reflecting on the simulation experience and drawing connections to real-world social dynamics

Remember that while SIMSOC has defined mechanics and procedures, there is no single "correct" way to participate. The simulation's value lies in the emergent social dynamics and the insights participants gain through their collective experience.

**Continuous Activity**: Players can take multiple actions during each turn  
**Communication Focus**: Heavy emphasis on player-to-player interaction and negotiation  
**Form Processing**: Official transactions processed via coordinator forms
**End-of-Session**: National Indicators calculated, incomes distributed, status updated

## Society Size Scaling

**Size Levels 1-5**: All economic values, starting resources, and group incomes scale based on total number of participants
**Automatic Adjustment**: Coordinator determines appropriate size level before game begins
**Consistent Ratios**: Maintains economic balance regardless of player count

## Victory Conditions

**No Traditional Victory**: Game focuses on social learning rather than winning
**Success Metrics**: 
- Individual goal achievement
- Group objective success  
- Society survival and functioning
- Learning about social dynamics and cooperation

**Failure Conditions**:
- Any National Indicator reaches zero (society collapse)
- Inability to maintain basic social functions
- Loss of game's educational value through rule violations

## Design Philosophy

The mechanics create tensions between:
- Individual survival vs. collective welfare
- Economic growth vs. resource/social costs  
- Group loyalty vs. society-wide cooperation
- Short-term gains vs. long-term sustainability
- Order/control vs. freedom/democracy

These tensions drive emergent social dynamics, political coalitions, economic strategies, and moral decisions that mirror real-world societal challenges.

## General Constraints

The following fundamental prohibitions function as "laws of nature" within the simulation and cannot be circumvented:

1. Appropriation of resources from the bank or other participants without explicit consent is prohibited.
2. Physical force is not permitted. The simulation provides mechanisms (Simforce) for resolving conflicts that would otherwise involve force.
3. Counterfeiting of Simbucks or other resources undermines the economic system and is forbidden.
4. Forging another participant's signature without their express permission violates basic trust principles.
