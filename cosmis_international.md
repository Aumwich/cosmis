# Cosmis: International

*Ideas and architecture considerations for multi-nation implementation*

## Overview

Cosmis: International is an expanded version of the Cosmis Discord adaptation of SIMSOC that supports multiple simultaneous nations and over one hundred players. This document captures ideas and architectural considerations for this future expansion while the core Cosmis implementation is being developed.

## Multi-Nation Mechanics

### Nation Structure
- Each nation operates as a semi-independent SIMSOC simulation
- Nations can interact through diplomacy, trade, and potentially conflict
- Players primarily belong to one nation but may have mechanisms to travel or migrate
- Each nation has its own set of National Indicators

### Cross-Nation Interactions
- **Trade System**: Nations can establish trade agreements for resources
- **Diplomatic Relations**: Nations can form alliances or declare conflicts
- **Migration**: Players might be able to change citizenship under certain conditions
- **International Organizations**: Meta-groups that span multiple nations

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Discord Server Structure
- **Federation Model**: Multiple interconnected Discord servers vs. single mega-server
- **Channel Organization**: How to organize hundreds of channels across multiple nations
- **Role Hierarchy**: Managing potentially thousands of roles and permissions

### Database Architecture
- **Sharding Strategy**: How to partition data across multiple nations
- **Transaction Volume**: Handling significantly increased transaction volume
- **Consistency Requirements**: Maintaining data consistency across nation boundaries

### Bot Architecture
- **Microservices Approach**: Breaking functionality into nation-specific and global services
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing computational load across multiple bot instances
- **Failover Strategy**: Ensuring system resilience with higher player counts

## Scaling Challenges

### Performance Considerations
- **Message Rate Limits**: Discord API limits for high-volume interactions
- **Computation Optimization**: More efficient algorithms for national indicator calculations
- **Caching Strategy**: Effective caching to reduce database load

### Moderation Challenges
- **Automated Moderation Tools**: Scaling human moderation with AI assistance
- **Cross-Nation Disputes**: Handling conflicts that span nation boundaries
- **Consistent Rule Enforcement**: Maintaining consistent application of rules across nations

### User Experience
- **Navigation**: Making it intuitive to navigate a much larger simulation
- **Information Overload**: Preventing players from being overwhelmed
- **Onboarding**: Efficiently introducing new players to a complex multi-nation system

## Feature Ideas

### Nation-Specific Features
- **Cultural Differences**: Nations could have slight rule variations or unique features
- **Resource Disparities**: Nations might start with different resource distributions
- **Government Systems**: Different default governance structures

### International Features
- **Global Events**: Events that affect multiple or all nations simultaneously
- **International Competitions**: Structured competitions between nations
- **Global Marketplace**: Trading platform spanning all nations

### Private Transportation Expansion
- Nation-specific private transportation passes
- International transportation passes (at premium prices)
- Different transportation tiers with varying privileges

### Luxury Living Expansion
- Nation-specific luxury lounges
- International luxury status (accessible in all nations)
- Ultra-luxury class with special diplomatic privileges

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Approach
1. **Core Cosmis**: Complete and refine single-nation implementation
2. **Dual-Nation Prototype**: Test with just two interconnected nations
3. **Scaling Infrastructure**: Develop architecture for 5+ nations
4. **Full International Release**: Support for 10+ nations and 100+ players

### Technical Prerequisites
- Distributed database architecture
- Load-balanced bot infrastructure
- Enhanced monitoring and logging systems
- Automated scaling capabilities

## Open Questions

- How to balance nation populations?
- How to handle cross-nation economic disparities?
- What mechanisms should govern international relations?
- How to prevent dominant strategy problems across nations?
- What's the optimal Discord server architecture for 100+ simultaneous players?
